The market size of the medical devices sector in India is estimated to be $11 billion (approximately, ₹ 90,000 Cr) in 2020 and its share in the global medical device market is estimated to be 1.5%. The Indian medical devices sector is on a growth track and has an enormous potential to become self-reliant and to contribute towards the goal of universal health care. The Government of India has already initiated implementation of PLI Scheme for medical devices and support for setting up of 4 Medical devices Parks in the States of Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh. Under the PLI scheme for Medical Devices, till now, a total of 26 projects have been approved, with a committed investment of Rs.1206 Cr and out of this, so far, an investment of Rs.714 Cr has been achieved. Under the PLI scheme, total of 14 projects producing 37 products have been commissioned and domestic manufacturing of high-end medical devices has started which include Linear Accelerator, MRI Scan, CT-Scan, Mammogram, C-Arm, MRI Coils, high end X-ray tubes, etc. Remaining 12 products will be commissioned in near future. Five projects out of total 26 projects have been approved recently, under Category B, for domestic manufacturing of 87 products / product components. Building upon these measures, a holistic policy framework to accelerate this growth and fulfil the potential of the sector is the need of the hour. While various Departments of the Government have undertaken programmatic interventions to encourage the sector, the current policy aims to put in place a comprehensive set of focus areas for growth of the sector in a coordinated manner. Secondly, in view of the diversity and multi-disciplinary nature of the sector, the regulations, skilling trade promotion of medical device industry are spread over several departments in the Government both at the Centre and State levels. There is a need to bring together the range of interventions in a coherent manner that would facilitate focused and efficient support and facilitation for the sector by the respective agencies. The National Medical Devices Policy, 2023 is expected to facilitate an orderly growth of the medical device sector to meet the public health objectives of access, affordability, quality and innovation. This sector is expected to realize its full potential, with the strategies viz, building an enabling ecosystem for manufacturing along with a focus on innovation, creating a robust and streamlined regulatory framework, providing support in training and capacity building programs and promoting higher education to foster talent and skilled resources in line with the industry requirements.

The step will add approximately 15,700 nursing graduates every year. This will further ensure quality, affordable, and equitable nursing education in India, particularly in underserved districts and States/Union Territories. The total financial implication will be Rs.1,570 crore. The initiative aims to address the geographical and rural-urban imbalances in the healthcare sector, which have led to the skewed availability of nursing professionals and impacted healthcare services in underserved areas. The establishment of these nursing colleges will provide a significant boost to the availability of qualified human resources in healthcare. This is also being done as a part of the national mandate for Universal Health Care (UHC) and will help in attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Reforms in regulatory structure for Nursing education to meet with the emerging requirements in the sector are also under consideration. National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) also collaborates with leading International & National agencies for skill development and placement of qualified nurses for overseas positions. Co-location of these nursing colleges with existing medical colleges will allow optimal utilization of the existing infrastructure, skill labs, clinical facilities, and faculty. This initiative is expected to provide better clinical exposure to nursing students and will also result in better care and service provision for patients in medical colleges. Use of green technologies will also be explored in these Nursing colleges and will be adopted as per relevancy to ensure energy efficiency and reduction in carbon footprint. The Government plans to complete the project within next two years and has laid out detailed timelines for every stage of planning as well as execution of the project. The Empowered Committee headed by the Union Health Secretary in the Centre and Principal Secretary, Health/Medical Education in the States will monitor the progress of the work. The State Government/UTs will intimate to MoHFW on regular basis, the physical progress of the works being done for the establishment of new nursing colleges under the scheme.

The Government has increased number of medical colleges and subsequently increased MBBS seats in last few years. There is substantial increase of\\xa0 around 71% in Medical Colleges from 387 before 2014 to 660 as of now. Further, the number of MBBS seats have almost doubled and Post Graduate seats have more than doubled since 2013-14. The services of Indian Nurses are considerably recognized in foreign countries, so it is important to bring Indian nursing education at par with the global standards in order to facilitate their mobility and better employment opportunities. They are recognized as highly skilled professionals and drive the healthcare delivery system, but their numerical strength is below global norms and needs to be adequately enhanced. *****\\nDS\\n\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Cabinet_approves_revised_domestic_gas_pr.txt', 'Ministry': 'Cabinet_Committee_on_Economic_Affairs_CC', 'Month': 'Apr23html'}, page_content=\"Cabinet approves revised domestic gas pricing guidelines\\n\\n\\nThe Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the revised domestic natural gas pricing guidelines for gas produced from nomination fields of ONGC/OIL, New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) blocks and pre-NELP blocks, where Production Sharing Contract (PSC) provides for Government's approval of prices. The price of such natural gas shall be 10% of the monthly average of Indian Crude Basket and shall be notified on a monthly basis. For the gas produced by ONGC & OIL from their nomination blocks, the Administered Price \\xa0Mechanism (APM) price shall be subject to a floor and a ceiling. Gas produced from new wells or well interventions in the nomination fields of ONGC & OIL, would be allowed a premium of 20% over the APM price. A detailed notification is being separately issued. The new guidelines are intended to ensure stable pricing regime for domestic gas consumers while at the same time providing adequate protection to producers from adverse market fluctuation with incentives for enhancing production. Government has targeted to increase the share of natural gas in primary energy mix in India from current 6.5% to 15% by 2030. The reforms shall help expand the consumption of natural gas and will contribute to achievement of target of emission reduction and net zero. These reforms are a continuation of the various initiatives taken by Government of India to protect the interests of consumers by reducing the impact of increase in international gas prices on gas prices in India by significantly increasing the domestic gas allocation to City Gas Distribution sector. The reforms will lead to significant decrease in prices of Piped Natural Gas (PNG) for households and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) for transport. The reduced prices shall also lower the fertilizer subsidy burden and help the domestic power sector. With the provision of a floor in gas prices as well as provision for 20% premium for new wells, this reform will incentivize ONGC and OIL to make additional long term investments in the upstream sector leading to greater production of natural gas and consequent reduction in import dependence of fossil fuels. The revised pricing guidelines will also promote lower carbon footprint through the growth of gas-based economy. Currently, the domestic gas prices are determined as per the new Domestic Gas Pricing Guidelines, 2014 which were approved by Government in 2014. The 2014 pricing guidelines provided for declaration for domestic gas prices for a 6 month period based on the volume weighted prices prevailing at four gas trading hubs - Henry Hub, Albena, National Balancing Point (UK), and Russia for a period of 12 months and a time lag of a quarter. As the earlier guidelines based on 4 gas hubs had a significant time lag and very high volatility, the need for this rationalization and reform was felt. The revised guidelines make prices linked to crude, which is a practice now followed in most industry contracts, is more relevant to our consumption basket and has deeper liquidity in global trading markets, on a real time basis. With the changes now approved, data of Indian Crude basket price from the previous month would form the basis for APM gas price determination. ***\\nDS\\n\"),\n",

Indian resource is significantly lean w.r.t. grade and it is tied with radioactivity making the extraction long, complex and expensive. Further, Indian resource contain Light Rare Earth Elements (LREE) while Heavy Rare Earth Elements (HREE) are not available in extractable quantities. In case of rare earths, a long drawn eco-system in value chain is required to move from reserves to finished product comprising of large number of processes/plants. This includes obtaining statutory clearances, mining, mineral beneficiation, RE extraction, separation, refining in oxides, metal extraction, alloy making. Specific to RE magnet, one need to convert alloy to magnet and thereafter application of finished product as motor in energy saving appliances. As such in a finished product, usage of rare earths is in minuscule quantity. While India has existing facilities from mining to separation and refining in oxide form and also developed capability of metal extraction, but further industrial scale facilities (intermediate) from alloy, magnet etc. are non-existent. In these alloys, RE is a minor component and other than Rare Earth Elements (REE) many other materials are required. Though from the stages of metal extraction onwards, the sector is under free category,industry in the intermediate segment have not been established due to non-availability of technology. 13.07 million tonnes in-situ monazite (containing ~55-60% total Rare Earth Elements oxide) resource occurring in the coastal beach placer sands in parts of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat and in the inland placers in parts of Jharkhand, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu. More than 80 % of the usage of rare earths in value terms is in RE permanent magnets which require Magnetic REE i.e. Neodymium, Praseodymium, Dysprosium and Terbium. These are precious REE since they find use in energy transition initiatives. High value REE are Dysprosium and Terbium which are not available in extractable quantities in Indian reserves already under exploitation. In Indian deposits, only Neodymium and Praseodymium are available and are being extracted upto 99.9 % purity level. Neodymium and Praseodymium occur in the BSM ore of Indian deposits to the extent of 0.0011 to 0.012%. Minability of REE is further constrained due to CRZ regulations, Mangroves, Forest and inhabitation. In India, capability for exploiting its rare earth resources (Light rare earths) upto metal extraction exist. With regard to foreign collaboration, Toyotsu Rare Earths India Limited, Visakhapatnam, a subsidiary of Toyoto Tsusho Corporation, Japan is engaged in refining of rare earths by sourcing rare earth concentrate from IREL.

G20 Space Economy Leaders Meeting is being organised under India’s G20 presidency by the Department of Space, Government of India,\\nThe Minister said that India is one of the very few countries who have built end to end capability in space. Over these years, space technology has penetrated to all walks of life. As a result, there is a huge demand for space based services which have huge commercial potential, he said. Dr Jitendra Singh said that under the able leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the Government has decided to open up the space sector for the Indian private industry through the 2020 Space Sector reforms to enhance their participation in end-to-end space activities with hand holding of ISRO. The Minister further said that the reforms aim to make private industries a co-traveller in India’s Space journey by allowing them to undertake independent end to end space activities. The increased private industry participation will eventually result in increased contribution of India in the global space economy. Dr Jitendra Singh said that a nodal entity called Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Center IN-SPACehas been created towards promoting and authorising private industries participation. The creation of IN-SPACe has received overwhelming response from the Indian space industry. The first privately built sounding rocket was launched last November and a space start-up has established a launch pad inside ISRO’s launch complex. A few start-ups have built and launched satellites, he added. The Minister said that in order to give further boost to private investments, the Union Cabinet had approved India's space policy which envisages and encourages private participation in all areas of space activities. Dr Jitendra Singh appreciated the Department of Space for organising the Space Economy Leaders Meeting at Bengaluru and a Precursor event at Shillong.

Shri Tomar also released a booklet titled \"Machinery for Millets Production, Processing and Value Addition\". On this occasion, Shri Tomar said that agriculture is our priority, so whether it is research or initiating schemes, the first priority of the government is to promote agriculture and improve the financial condition of the farmers. Today there are many challenges in the Agriculture sector. To retain the farmers, to attract the new generation and to increase the remuneration of the farmers by reducing the cost of production. For this, technical support in the agriculture sector is very important, the government is making continuous efforts in this direction. Union Minister Shri Tomar said that there are possibilities of new challenges in the agriculture sector, therefore, along with change in strategy from time to time, change in methodology is necessary. Talking about the agriculture sector, without the support of technology, we will not be able to achieve our goals in the future, so efforts are being made to link the schemes with technology. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi also always emphasizes on the support of technology and also works on them himself. Talking about major schemes, today under the Prime Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi, about Rs 2.5 lakh crore have reached the accounts of the farmers, in which there is no question mark. The micro irrigation project is also yielding good results. Topics like Natural Farming are being taken forward. Our country made Nano Urea and the farmers will soon be able to avail the benefits of Nano DAP. Drone technology has been accepted by the government in the Agriculture sector. Last time when there was an outbreak of locusts, the need for the use of drones was felt at that time, since then drone technology is before us with the full support of the central government under the guidance of Prime Minister Shri Modi. In reducing the cost in agriculture and avoiding the side effects of pesticides, farmers will get extensive benefits from drones. Shri Tomar said that whenever we undertake any new scheme, we must keep in mind that its benefits reach the last person. This is the reason why when the scheme of drones was being made, common farmers, common graduates were also included in it, so that the use of drones could be made accessible to small farmers. Everyone needs to work together in this direction. For this, he stressed on the need to make Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) more efficient and said that awareness sessions should be organized for graduate/post-graduate agricultural students in agricultural universities & colleges, through which they can get employment, besides making them capable for farming on their own land. A plan should be made for the benefits of drones to reach the common man. Shri Tomar said that on the initiative of Prime Minister Shri Modi, according to the declaration of the United Nations, the year 2023 is being celebrated worldwide as the International Year of Millets (Shree Anna). Shree Anna is getting priority and recognition in various events. For this our responsibility has increased along with making us proud. If the demand and consumption of Shree Anna will increase in the country and the world, then along with production-productivity, processing and export will also have to be increased.

Insights from these studies revealed that the natural farming, conservation of natural resources and willingness to adopt the Integrated Farming Systems (diversification) were the smallholder farmers’ most preferred topics covered in the Mann Ki Baat episodes. Another assessment with millet farmers revealed that the message communicated through Mann Ki Baat interaction and follow-up actions by the Krishi Vigyan Kendra professionals have strengthened farmers’ perceptions on the process of adoption of improved varieties of millets and production system and created congenial environment for agri-entrepreneurship. Digital technology, including drone and mobile, highlighted in Mann Ki Baat episode(s), was found to have significant influence on increase in farmers’ awareness and knowledge about adoption of agricultural technology. Mann Ki Baat could also create a positive environment on Farmers Producer Organizations (FPOs) to ease the agri-business and reducing the cost of cultivation of farmers (20-25%). Study on beekeeping showed that after the Mann Ki Baat programme, beekeepers, with better exposure to institutional knowledge and resources, were found to earn better profit in group than individual one, except technical problems being faced. Message on Kisan Rail could also sensitize and mobilize the farmers to avail its services. The Kisan Rail could facilitate farmers to transport their perishable agri-produce with lesser time and higher net profits with reduced involvement of middlemen. Therefore, we learned that Mann Ki Baat programme was crucial in creating favourable environment among the farmers for enhancing awareness and their mobilization. *Note: These studies are published and available online from Indian Journal of Agricultural Sciences[93(4): 351-357; 93(4):358-364; 93(5): 3-11], Indian Journal of Extension Education[2023, 59 (3):1-6; 2023, 59(3):8-13)]; Journal of Community Mobilization & Sustainable Development [2023, 18(1): 315-327; 2023, 18(1): 79-88]and Journal of Agricultural Extension Management [2023, XXIV (1): 1-21;2023, XXIV No. (1):51-83.'),\n",

This programme was started on 03 October 2014, and since then it has covered a total of 99 episodes till 26 March 2023. Agricultural issues have also been mentioned in several episodes to inspire and motivate the farming community and other stakeholders in order to drive the agricultural innovations and development on oilseeds and pulses; technology transfer from Lab to Land; climate resilient agriculture; organic farming; Integrated Farming System approach; conservation of natural resources; beekeeping; millets production and consumption; use of drone in agriculture, etc. In order to assess the influence and learning environment among the farmers and other stakeholders, created by Mann Ki Baat, Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), New Delhi and National Institute of Agricultural Extension Management, (MANAGE), Hyderabad have conducted a study*. Insights from these studies revealed that the natural farming, conservation of natural resources, and willingness to adopt the Integrated Farming Systems (diversification) were the smallholder farmers’ most preferred topics covered in the Mann Ki Baat episodes. The Mann Ki Baat was perceived as a credible source of inspiration and medium of mass-scale awareness for agriculture and entrepreneurial development. Another assessment with millet farmers revealed that the message communicated through Mann Ki Baat interactions and follow-up actions by the Krishi Vigyan Kendra professionals have strengthened farmers’ perceptions on the process of adoption of improved varieties of millets and production system, and created congenial environment for agri-entrepreneurship. Additionally, Mann Ki Baat inspired the agri-startups to focus on innovative solutions benefiting the farmers. Digital technology, highlighted in Mann Ki Baat’s episode(s), was found to have significant influence on increase in farmers’ awareness and knowledge about the use of mobile-based agro-advisory services in the field of adoption of agricultural technology; yield enhancement; and making available the market information. Similarly, study on agri-drone captured in Mann Ki Baat indicated that majority of the study farmers (with favorable attitude) perceived drone as useful technology for agricultural operations. However, a significant number of them also expressed the concern of complexity in understanding this technology. Mann Ki Baat could also create a favorable environment on Farmers Producer Organizations (FPOs) to ease the agri-business, making easy availability of inputs for high value crops, and collective action that could reduce the cost of cultivation of farmers (20-25%). FPO farmers opined that with Mann Ki Baat episodes, they became aware even on different policies and schemes of Government of India promoting agri-businesses. Study on beekeeping showed that existing resources of this sector got mobilized after the Mann Ki Baat programme. Beekeepers, with better exposure to institutional knowledge and resources, were found to earn better profit in group (Rs. 1,28,328 per 50 bee hives) than individual one (Rs. 92,947). However, ‘pesticide residual problems’ and ‘lack of proper storage facility’ were some of the major obstacles faced by the beekeepers. Message on Kisan Rail could also sensitize and mobilize the farmers to avail its services. The Kisan Rail could facilitate farmers to transport their perishable agri-produce with lesser time that could helpin securing their higher net profits with reduced middleman involvement. Furthermore, Mann Ki Baat episodes were also learned to be successful in creating awareness and positive attitude towards the organic/natural farming. Farmers suggested that- if Mann Ki Baat messages on a particular issue in future can be coincided with seasonal activities, it can make even further influence in making the farmers aware. Therefore, we learned that Mann Ki Baat programme played valuable role in inspiring and making farmers aware on various agricultural issues. *Note: These studies are published and available online from Indian Journal of Agricultural Sciences(),Indian Journal of Extension Education[2023, 59 (3):1-6; 2023, 59(3):8-13)]; Journal of Community Mobilization &Sustainable Development [2023, 18(1): 315-327; 2023, 18(1): 79-88]and Journal of Agricultural Extension Management [2023, XXIV (1): 1-21;2023, XXIV No. (1):51-83\\n*****\\nPK\\n'),\n",

Dr. Manoj Ahirwar Scientist, Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Damoh, JNKVV, M.P briefed about Technological intervention for yield enhancement in Agricultural/Horticultural Crops by using advanced tools in beekeeping. By using better beehive technology, we can have a significant positive impact on honey output and increase horticultural production. Beekeepers need to be encouraged to adopt or continue using the technology because the return on investment, i.e. productivity increases, is realised. Since improved beehive technology adoption has multiplier effects ranging from increased beekeeping productivity to economic growth and poverty reduction, the development of Bee Breeders for the enhancement of the beekeeping sector can be achieved by recognising desirable characters among the varieties of honeybees and by implementing systematic and planned activities aimed at the sustained genetic improvement of the honey bee population. He also described the role of the NBHM and its support for the beekeeping industry among farmers, beekeepers and students to accept and start beekeeping and honey production, as well as increase their income. He has also enlightened the farmers of Madhya Pradesh that there is immense potential for honey production in the state as there are many potential farmers and the tribal population is high, which creates more potential for beekeeping and honey production. Beekeeping will be promoted in villages and several other districts of Madhya Pradesh, which are rich in agriculture and have sizeable indigenous population. The latest step by the NBHM will not only help raise beekeeping and honey production and crop protection but also provide livelihood to the indigenous population in the districts of Madhya Pradesh. Dr. Pramod Mall, Principal Scientist, GB Pant, University, Pantnagar (Uttarakhand), highlighted the Development of Quality Nucleus Stock Centre as an essential practice to improve and increase honey production.

On this occasion, Shri Tomar said that today we have come out of the slavery mentality of the British era, today the whole scenario has changed and this has become possible because of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. Union Minister Shri Tomar said that there was a time when there was talent in our country and we were not able to recognize it. There was no environment for these talents to showcase their talent. This is the reason why the talented were getting frustrated with the country and they were forced to go abroad, but today it is not so. Prime Minister Shri Modi grasped this situation and created a positive environment in the country, due to which not only India but the whole world has changed. Shri Tomar said that before 2014, there used to be only 31-32 Startups in the country, but today their number has increased to more than 6,500. In the Agriculture sector alone, their number is above 2,000. He said that today the whole world is recognizing the power of India and also accepting its stature. Union Minister Shri Tomar said that under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Modi, India's identity has been established in the whole world and India's position has also improved in the world. This is the reason why the Prime Minister of India could pause the war between Ukraine and Russia by saying that first let our citizens be evacuated, proving India's growing clout in the world affairs.

MurmuLandmark contribution of scientists in the development of animal husbandry-dairy sector -Shri Tomar\\nThe President Smt. Droupadi Murmu graced the 19th convocation ceremony of the National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal in its centenary year. Governor of Haryana, Shri Bandaru Dattatreya, Chief Minister Shri Manohar Lal Khattar, Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Shri Narendra Singh Tomar, Union Minister of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Shri Parshottam Rupala, Union Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Shri Kailash Choudhary, Director General of ICAR, Dr. Himanshu Pathak were the special guests at the convocation. The President Smt. Murmu said that women power is playing an important role in the management of dairy industry in India. More than 70 percent participation in the Dairying sector is by women. It is heartening to note that today more than one-third of degree awardees are girls, 50 per cent of gold medalists are also girls. President Smt. Murmu said that the Dairying sector has special significance in making women self-reliant as well as in bringing changes in their social and economic status. We need to ensure that these women have equal rights and opportunities to make decisions and provide leadership. For this, there is a need to provide more opportunities for education, training and skill development to these women. Along with this, there should be facility of easy loan and market access to women to make them entrepreneurs in dairy farming. She congratulated the farmers of Punjab and Haryana while mentioning the special role played by them in the success of Green Revolution as well as the White Revolution. She said that milk and milk derivatives have always been an integral part of Indian food and culture. Along with mother's milk, cow's milk is also considered nectar for health. In the Rigveda it is said ‘गोषु प्रियम् अमृतं रक्षमाणा’, meaning, cow milk is like nectar, which protects against diseases. Milk is considered holy, so it is also used for the consecration of the deities. Even today, women in the country are blessed with 'दूधो नहाओ-पूतो फलो' by the elders. Cow and other livestock have been an integral part of Indian society and traditions. In Indian tradition, livestock including cow is considered a symbol of prosperity and good fortune. The stories of Shri Krishna's love for the cow, Shivji and Nandi are included in our culture. Animal Husbandry is the main means of livelihood in the agro-based rural economy. The President said that the dairy industry plays an important role in ensuring food and nutritional security of the country. It is a matter of pride that India is the largest milk producing country in the world. India accounts for about 22 percent of the global milk production. Dairy sector contributes about 5 percent to the country's GDP and dairy industry provides livelihood to about 8 crore families, therefore institutions like NDRI have an important role in the inclusive development of the country. NDRI, established in the year 1923, has made a significant contribution to the development of the dairy industry in India. The institute's research has helped in improving productivity, efficiency and quality in the dairy production sector. She expressed happiness that the technology to produce clones of high milk yielding buffaloes and cows has been developed by the NDRI. With this, the milk production capacity of the cattle will be increased and the income of the farmers will rise. She said that due to the increasing population of the country, the demand for milk related products is increasing. Also, the dairy sector is grappling with problems such as management of good quality fodder for cattle, changes in weather due to climate change and cattle diseases. Making milk production and dairy farming sustainable is a challenge before us, for which it is the responsibility of all stakeholders including the government to find a solution to meet the needs of the country. It is our responsibility to develop the dairy industry by adopting environment friendly and climate smart technologies, keeping animal welfare in mind. She also expressed happiness that NDRI is promoting various technologies to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases from dairy farms. Along with this, emphasis is also being laid on sources of clean energy like biogas production. She told the students that you are moving towards a new chapter of life, you should always try to learn new things and work for the welfare of the people. Some of you students must become job providers and entrepreneurs in the dairy industry. There are immense possibilities of growth in this industry and you should take advantage of these possibilities. Efforts are being made by NDRI to promote entrepreneurship and startups in the dairy sector in different parts of the country. It is expected that you will start as an entrepreneur by taking advantage of this and other schemes of the government and make the best contribution to the progress of the nation. Union Minister Shri Tomar said that the NDRI is a very important institution of the country, which has completed a glorious journey of 100 years. ICAR affiliated NDRI has secured First position for five consecutive years in the competition among agricultural universities across the country, which is a matter of pride. He said that the contribution of scientists in the Animal Husbandry-Dairying sector, where the country is standing today, is also a landmark. India is an agricultural country, in which it is not possible to imagine the Agriculture sector without Animal Husbandry and Fisheries. Especially the livelihood of small and landless farmers also depends on Animal Husbandry. Animal Husbandry has a significant contribution in the GDP of Agriculture. There is a need to keep moving forward while solving the challenges in this area. He said that the per capita availability of milk in the country in the year 2021-22 was 444 grams per day, while the global average during 2021 was 394 grams per day. There has been an increase of about 44% in the per capita availability of milk in the country between 2013-14 to 2021-22. Shri Tomar said that for any student, the convocation ceremony is an unforgettable moment in his life, it is even more a matter of pride that this occasion coincides with the centenary celebrations of the institute. Congratulating the students who received the degree, he said that they are going to be of great service to the country. Governor of Haryana, Shri Dattatreya, Chief Minister Shri Manohar Lal and Union Minister Shri Rupala also addressed the ceremony. During the convocation, undergraduate-postgraduate & Ph.D. degrees were presented and Gold medals awarded to the best students.

In his opening remarks Shri Tomar said that the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi is working with full commitment through various schemes and programmes for the all-round development of the country. It must be ensured there is 100% implementation of these schemes in the Union Territories as well, all the farmers there should also get the benefit of welfare schemes. Work should be done by finding compatibility in adversity. Union Agriculture Minister Shri Tomar said that proper development of Union Territories is the aim of the Government of India. It is the endeavour of Prime Minister Shri Modi that the benefits of the schemes of the Central Government reach the last person, that is why Union Ministers and other senior officials visit the villages of the border areas. Prime Minister Shri Modi says that the village situated on the border is not the last, but the first village of our country. Assuming this, we should do the work of ensuring their development. The states have taken this call of the Prime Minister very sincerely. Shri Tomar told that just a few days ago he had gone to Ladakh, where there is adequate power supply to the villages adjacent to the border and under the Jal Jeevan Mission, every household is getting tap water. It is the result of Prime Minister Shri Modi's commitment and broad thinking that the dream of reaching the last person with the light of development is coming true. Shri Tomar said that the Union Territories and the Central Government complement each other. In these regions too, the path of development should be paved by solving difficulties with mutual dialogue and adaptability. He said that our Agriculture sector is very important and extensive, the number of small farmers is also high but there is enough adaptability to work. There is no dearth of schemes and funds with the Central Government, there is a need for complete implementation of the schemes. Shri Tomar said that all eligible farmers, animal herders and fishermen should get the benefits of Kisan Credit Card (KCC), Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi etc. So far, crores of farmers have received about 2.5 lakh crore rupees under the PM Kisan, credited to their accounts. The crops that are grown there should be promoted; along with other states, these regions should also be in the lead in the race for development. There should also be a change in the standard of living of the small farmers of the Union Territories. In the meeting, Union Agriculture Secretary Shri Manoj Ahuja along with officers of Union Territories also gave their views. Officials from Agriculture and other Central Ministries and concerned Central/State Institutions were present in the meeting. ****\\nSS/PK\\n\"),\n",

Shri Tomar said that there are about 85 percent small farmers in the country, who should get the benefit of technology & machinery. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the government is continuously working in this direction at its level. An amount of Rs.6120.85 crore has been released to the states from 2014-15 to 2022-23 for various activities like training, testing, setting up of CHCs, hi-tech hubs and Farm Machinery Banks (FMBs) under the Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM). Besides 15.24 lakh farm machinery and equipment have been distributed at subsidized rates through state governments, including tractors, power tillers and automated machinery. Chief Guest Union Minister Shri Tomar said that by implementing the new system at the Central Farm Machinery Training and Testing Institute (CFMTTI), Budni (M.P.), the Government of India has reduced the time taken for completing the testing of tractors to a maximum of 75 working days. Also, from the year 2014-15 to 2022-23, 1.64 lakh workers have been trained by the Central Government through its four FMTTI designated authorized test centers. The introduction of the Rupees One lakh crore Agricultural Infrastructure Fund is also an important step in this direction, in which projects worth Rs. 14,000 crore have been approved which are benefitting the farmers. Kisan drones are being promoted, for which along with introducing the drone policy, subsidies are being given to various sections including farmers, SC-ST category, women farmers while crop specific SOP has also been issued for application of pesticides with drones. Shri Tomar said that agriculture is a priority of the country, no one could destroy the fabric of our agriculture-based rural economy even in adverse circumstances. In terms of agricultural products, India stands at Number One or Second rank in the world today, which is a result of the hard work of the farmers, the contribution of scientists and industry, and the farmer friendly policies of the government with the support of technology. But we do not have to rest on our laurels, rather we have to prepare a roadmap keeping in view the requirement of the population that will increase by 2050 and in the changing political scenario, according to the growing importance of India in the world, we are concerned about meeting the needs of our country as well as other countries. While doing so, we have to play an important role. After 2014, a different type of work culture has taken roots in the country under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Modi. The changes that have come in these years have spread hope across the country and the world. If the resolution of the government is strong and the intent of the leader is noble, then the initiative is good and the ability to accept it also increases. Today, India is ahead of America, Japan and Germany in cashless transactions. The Union Minister said that when we are in the competition of production, we should increase it by comparing it with the production of foreign countries instead of the figures of previous years of our own country. We have to keep on increasing the production of food grains even if the land is less. Agricultural scientists have crucial role in this, as well as the importance of technology including machines has also increased in the present circumstances. The waste lands should also be made cultivable and according to the demand of the time, there is a need to attract the new generation towards agriculture. The government is working in this direction under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Modi. Farmers' access to the market has also been increased through e-NAM mandis and the gaps in the agriculture sector are being filled up, for which more than Rs 1.5 lakh crore packages have been earmarked for Agriculture and Allied sectors. He emphasized on taking technology like micro-irrigation to maximum number of farmers while saving water. Shri Bhartendu Kapoor, Shri Mukul Varshney, Shri Krishna Kant Tiwari, Shri Antony Cherukara and other office bearers and members were present in the program.

It has been developed by the NIC in collaboration with the Union Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare on the theme of ‘Uttam Beej – Samriddh Kisan’. On this occasion, Shri Tomar said that the Government of India is constantly trying to overcome the challenges and difficulties faced by Agriculture sector through various schemes and programmes. SATHI portal is an important step in this direction. When its use starts right to the grassroot level, it will prove to be a revolutionary step in the field of agriculture. Chief guest Union Minister Shri Tomar said that Agriculture is of great importance to India. This importance has increased in the changing scenario. Earlier, we had only the aim of fulfilling our needs in agriculture, but at present the expectations of the world are also increasing from India. In such a situation, it is our responsibility to help feed the world while dealing with all the challenges of agriculture, climate change etc. Shri Tomar said that seeds, pesticides, fertilizers and irrigation play a major role in agriculture. Inferior quality or spurious seeds affect the growth of agriculture. This causes loss to the farmers, it also affects the agricultural production of the country. It has been said from time to time that we should devise such a system so that the market of spurious seeds is checked and quality seeds reach the farmers, for this the SATHI portal has been launched today. In this era of climate change, new types of pests are affecting the crops, on which agricultural scientists should focus their research to eradicate the menace. If we are able to save this loss, then we can save 20 percent of the entire agricultural production. Union Minister Shri Tomar said that the first phase of SATHI (Seed Traceability, Authentication and Holistic) portal has just been launched. He directed the officials to ensure that the second phase does not take long. Efforts should be made to increase awareness so that the farmers get full benefit from it. There will be a QR code under this system, through which the seeds can be traced. Training should be imparted through Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), Krishi Vigyan Kendras and State Governments. He urged all the states to join the Seed Traceability System. SATHI portal will ensure quality assurance system, identify the source of seed in the seed production chain.

FAA, under its IASA program, conducted an audit of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), India from 25th to 29th October 2021 in the areas covering aircraft operations, airworthiness, and personnel licensing. The IASA assessment was followed by final consultations on 25th - 26th April 2022 and further review by the FAA in July 2022 and September 2022. Based on the positive outcomes of the assessment and follow-ups, the FAA informed DGCA on 12th April 2023 that India meets the international standards for aviation safety oversight of the Chicago Convention & its Annexes and continues to retain FAA IASA Category 1 status which was the last assessed in July 2018. The FAA has appreciated the DGCA stating that DGCA has demonstrated a commitment to ensuring the effective safety oversight of India’s aviation system. India's Category 1 determination has come at a time when the Indian aviation is on a high growth trajectory and air carriers in India have major capacity induction and expansion plans. Air carriers of Category 1 countries are permitted to operate/ expand their services to destinations in the USA and codeshare with US air carriers. India in the recent ICAO audit in November 2022 has scored an Effective Implementation (EI) of 85.65% from the previous EI of 69.95% thereby enhancing its global ranking significantly. The assessment by ICAO as well as FAA is a testimony to India's commitment to having an effective safety oversight for its civil aviation system. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the USA, under its International Aviation Safety Assessment (IASA) program, determines whether a country’s oversight of its air carriers that operate, or seek to operate, into the U.S., or codeshare with a U.S. air carrier, complies with safety standards established by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The IASA program focuses on a country's ability to adhere to international aviation Safety Standards and Recommended Practices contained in Annex 1 (Personnel Licensing), Annex 6 (Operation of Aircraft), and Annex 8 (Airworthiness of Aircraft) to the International Convention on Civil Aviation “Chicago Convention”. ***\\nYB/DNS\\n\"),\n",

International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has been entrusted to facilitate to reduce the carbon emissions from international civil aviation as one of its focus areas. In order to mitigate carbon emissions from aviation sector and its impacts on climate change. ICAO has adopted the aspirational goals, viz. 2% annual fuel efficiency improvement through 2050, Carbon Neutral Growth from 2020 onwards, and net zero by 2050. A basket of measures has also been identified by ICAO to achieve these goals which include the Carbon Offfsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and the Long Term Aspirational Goals (LTAG). CORSIA is implemented in three phases, out of which participation is voluntary in the first two phases for (2021-2026). India has decided not to participate in the voluntary phases of CORSIA. Offsetting requirement under the CORSIA for Indian careers will start from 2027. This will enable airlines of the developing countries like India to get time to grow more and do not face any financial consequences due to CORSIA by joining voluntary phases. CORSIA is applicable to international flights originating from one country to another. Financial implications due to offsetting will be born by individual airlines depending upon their international operations as and when applicable. India has committed to net zero by 2070 at COP26 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas (MoPNG) has notified\\xa0 a National Policy\\xa0 on Bio Fuels 2018 to realize the goal of de-carbonization of aviation sector. MoPNG constituted the Bio-Aviation Turbine Fuel Programme Committee to take forward the Bio-ATF Programme in the country to promote the use of clean fuel in aviation. The Committee has submitted its report which has now been circulated to various stakeholders. India has also taken several steps like joining ICAO’s Assistance Capacity Building & Training for Sustainable Aviation Fuels Programme.

The Ministry of Civil Aviation has disbursed an amount of Rs. 30 crores (approximately) to the beneficiaries during FY 2022-23 under the PLI Scheme for Drones and Drone Components. To promote the indigenous drone industry, the government notified the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for drones and drone components on 30th September 2021. The step was widely welcomed by academia and industry experts. This scheme has multiple features to help the industry such as:\\nThe total incentive is Rs. 120 crore spread over three financial years. It is nearly double the combined turnover of all domestic drone manufacturers in FY 2020-21. For this scheme, the PLI rate is 20% of the value addition which is one of the highest among PLI schemes. Under this scheme, the value addition is calculated as the annual sales revenue from drones and drone components (net of GST) minus the purchase cost (net of GST) of drone and drone components. The PLI rate is kept constant at 20% for all three years, which is an exceptional treatment for the drone industry in the country. The Minimum value addition norm has been at 40% of net sales for drones and drone components instead of 50% which is another exceptional treatment for the industry. The eligibility norm for MSMEs and startups is at nominal levels. The coverage of the scheme includes developers of drone-related software also. PLI for a manufacturer is capped at 25% of the total annual outlay. This allows for the widening of the number of beneficiaries. In case a manufacturer fails to meet the threshold for the eligible value addition for a particular financial year, she will be allowed to claim the lost incentive in the subsequent year if she makes up the shortfall in the subsequent year. A provisional list of 23 PLI beneficiaries was released on 6th July 2022. The beneficiaries include 12 drone manufacturers and 11 drone component manufacturers. ***\\nYB/PS\\n'),\n",

GoyalEach member of the diaspora is an ambassador of India: Sh. Goyal\\nUnion Minister of Commerce and Industry, Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, and Textiles, Shri Piyush Goyal said that the world is looking up to India in every sphere. He said that India deeply values its 25 years of strategic partnership with France and 75 years of friendship. He said that France is the preferred partner in defence, economy, investments, etc. and this 25-year journey truly is reflective of India's journey of progress. He said that India desires to strengthen this partnership with France. He said that the vibrant Indian Community in France acting as a true living Bridge between the two countries will relentlessly pursue a path that will further strengthen India’s ties with France in technology, investments, tourism, etc. The Minister narrated India’s development story on French soil during an interaction with the Indian diaspora in Paris, France yesterday & described how India is emerging as a bright spot on the global stage under the decisive leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. The Minister said that in 1947, as India gained independence it started regaining its place in the world. He said that this year India is celebrating 25 years of partnership with France and 75 years of India's independence. He said that while it's a great moment to reflect on all the good things that have been achieved in the last 75 years, it's also a great opportunity for each one of us to reflect on new ideas about how our country should progress in the future. The Minister noted the changes that have taken place in India over the last 9 years of government. He said that the focus of the government has been on ensuring that the basic needs of every single person in the country, particularly those at the lowest strata of society are taken care of. He said that the provision of housing for all, healthcare, food, clothing, shelter, etc. have been strongly pursued by the government at all levels. He appreciated the role played by the community leaders and Ekal Vidyalaya in supporting and empowering the tribal communities. He said that half of India until 2014 did not have a toilet, governments came and went but somehow that sensitivity was missing that our mothers, our sisters and our daughters deserve better dignity. He said that the respect and dignity which can come from a basic amenity like a toilet was realised by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and toilets were constructed throughout the country under the Swachh Bharat Mission so that today not a single sister has to face the indignity of not having this facility at home. For women empowerment, he said that the government has ensured cooking gas connection in nearly every home in the country to save the women from inhaling the harmful smoke from traditional cooking fuels like coal or wood. The Minister said that the government has also launched the Ayushman Bharat, the world's largest Healthcare scheme, ensuring free healthcare for around 500 million people. He also noted some other initiatives undertaken by the government like the new National Education policy promoting liberal education, digital connectivity, encouraging startups, Jal Jeevan Mission, etc. He said that these initiatives are reforming the entire country's way of working and leading India towards becoming a developed country. The Minister said that during the challenging period of COVID-19 pandemic, the government undertook sincere efforts to ensure that food, water, etc. was made available to every person in the country. He said the other countries of the world appreciated the manner in which the Indian government managed to take care of all the Indians despite the world's strictest lockdown to contain COVID. He said that these efforts undertaken by the government over the last 9 years are the building blocks and enablers that have prepared India to work in this new age of technology to provide a better quality of life for our people and build a nation of aspirational young Indians looking for a better future. He said that with every Indian empowered with skills and talent and with the basic requirements taken care of, the youth of India who watch the progress around the world on their smartphone can work for achieving bigger and better. He said that with more women coming into the workforce and with India moving rapidly towards adopting sustainability as the core of its working principles, along with rapid strides in manufacturing and service sectors India is on the right path towards becoming a developed country. He said that India offers huge opportunities to the rest of the world and India’s overall exports growing to US $ 765 Billion in 2022-23 is an example of a new India which is showing the path to the rest of the world, a new India with capability, capacity & confidence. The Minister said that each member of the diaspora is an ambassador of India. He said that the Indian Community in France can contribute to this journey of Amrit Kaal envisioned by the Prime Minister to see India as a developed Nation by 2047. He said that India must find its rightful place in the comity of Nations now as ‘this is the time, this is the right time’ as said by the Prime Minister. ***\\nAD/VN\\n\"),\n",

This was stated by Minister of Commerce & Industry, Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, and Textiles, Shri Piyush Goyal while addressing the annual convocation of MDI Gurgaon and Murshidabad. He said that given the high quality of students, faculty and work that is carried out in the institution, MDI should engage with the private sector and the government so that all of us can benefit from the achievements of the institution. He said that the students of MDI are the future entrepreneurs, innovators, changemakers and leaders of India who are going to contribute in the Amrit Kaal as the country moves to centenary of Independence. He noted that we have over 65 % girls who have joined the MDI. That is a remarkable achievement for the organisation in terms of giving an opportunity to our daughters as they work their way up and become stakeholders in the growth story of India, he said. It is our collective duty to work with a sense of duty to ensure prosperity and inclusive growth in the country so that none is left behind, he added. The country today is working towards a vision of making India a developed nation by 2047 and this requires a deep understanding of the challenges. Education from MDI will play an important role for its students in this, Shri Goyal said, adding that he hoped to see the students as value creators and many as budding innovators and entrepreneurs. Today the Govt is also thinking like a Startup continuously experimenting with ideas to take development to the last mile, he said. Lauding the vision of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, Shri Goyal said that the PM always speaks of the power of India’s youth. “India’s youth are the growth engines of the country and India is the world’s growth engine,” he quoted. It is our collective duty to take this country forward skillfully, as the world today looks up to India. Whenever there is any distress anywhere in the world, India is at the forefront of the collective effort to help find solutions, Shri Goyal said adding that whether it is providing vaccines or supporting neighbours in the times of distress, India always stands up and is counted and trusted upon to be a friend in need. India is today called the Pharmacy of the World as the vaccines and medicines were exported while ensuring adequate domestic supplies for our citizens during the pandemic. He spoke of VUCA Solutions which is ‘Vision, Understanding, Clarity and Agility’ in our work will help us navigate the challenges of tomorrow. He ended with the belief that MDI students will come up with innovations and solutions for our farmers, artisans and other diverse sectors and contribute to India’s growth story. ***\\nAD\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'India_jumps_6_places_to_Rank_38_in_World.txt', 'Ministry': 'Ministry_of_Commerce_Industry', 'Month': 'Apr23html'}, page_content='India jumps 6 places to Rank 38 in World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index 2023\\n\\nIndia sees remarkable improvement on 4 out of 6 LPI indicatorsLPI report appreciates NICDC’s Logistics Data Bank\\nIndia improves in the logistics ranking of the World Bank by jumping 6 places to Rank 38 out of 139 countries in the 7th edition of Logistics Performance Index (LPI 2023). India has been taking numerous initiatives since 2015 under the visionary leadership of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to improve its logistics efficiency. The World Bank has acknowledged India’s efforts towards increasing logistics efficiency. On 4 out of 6 LPI indicators India has seen remarkable improvement on the back of various initiatives being implemented over the past few years. This is a strong indicator of India’s global positioning, with this development being powered by our Government’s laser focus on reforms for improving logistics infrastructure. In October 2021, the Government of India launched the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (PMGS-NMP) towards a coordinated approach, leveraging technology, for infrastructure planning and development. PMGS envisages breaking silos among different Departments / Ministries in States / UTs by combining all relevant data on a National Master Plan and State Master Plans (portals) respectively. It is a GIS based tool which integrates existing and proposed infrastructure initiatives of different Central Ministries, to ensure first and last-mile connectivity, for seamless movement of people and goods. At the heart is intense communication and extensive data sharing among Central and State agencies promoting collaborative approach. Through the power of technology and collaborative efforts of concerned agencies put together, PM GatiShakti addresses the emerging needs of transforming the logistics landscape due to factors like rapid urbanization, changing energy choices, e-commerce, need to develop resilient supply chains etc. In September 2022, the Prime Minister launched the National Logistics Policy (NLP) which acts as a guiding document for States / UTs seeking to formulate logistics policy (19 States / UTs have notified their logistics policy). The policy is centred around upgradation and digitisation of logistics infrastructure & services. Further with focus on bringing efficiency in services (processes, digital systems, regulatory framework) and human resources, the policy puts marked emphasis on streamlining processes for seamless coordination, and reduction in overall logistics cost, besides incentivizing employment generation and skilling of the workforce. NLP lays emphasis on the shift towards more energy-efficient modes of transportation and greener fuels to reduce the carbon footprint. The policy also focusses on adopting the usage of multimodal transportation and complementing it by building multimodal logistics parks. Further it emphasized on the importance of targeted policy reforms to improve time spent by cargo at port, airports, and multimodal facilities since most of the delays occur at these locations. The Government of India also invested in trade-related soft and hard infrastructure connecting port gateways on both coasts to the economic zones in hinterland. Technology has been a critical component of this effort, with implementation under a public-private partnership of a supply chain visibility platform, which has contributed to remarkable reductions of delays. NICDC’s Logistics Data Bank project applies radio frequency identification (RFID) tags to containers and offers consignees end-to-end tracking of their supply chain. Its implementation started in 2016 on the Western part of India and was scaled up to Pan India level in 2020. With such initiatives of transparency, visibility, and ease of doing business, there has been significant improvement in cross-border trade facilitation. Also, the Logistics Data Bank project promotes healthy competition amongst the ports as it provides information on performance benchmarking, congestion, dwell time, speed, and transit time analysis. Over a period, it has also become a repository of data & information relating to the logistics industry and the same is shared with the stakeholders through monthly, quarterly, and annual reports as a source of data for decision making and improving logistics efficiency. The LPI report appreciates the Logistics Data Bank which reduces inefficiencies while connecting hinterland to ports. At a sub-National level, the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) has been conducting LEADS (Logistics Ease Across Different States) study since 2018 which helps to identify and resolve logistics inefficiencies and improve trade facilitation across supply chains. On a national level, India has notified Productivity Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for boost to creating global champions in manufacturing, PM Mitra Textile Parks, Bulk Drug Parks, other areas of manufacturing and 43 Towns of Export Excellence meticulously focusing on specific sectors for exports and provision of related infrastructure. Resolving the logistics gaps / bottlenecks will help decrease the logistics cost and will lead to increment in logistics efficiency which will contribute to ongoing reforms aimed at India becoming a global manufacturing / production hub in the coming years. Further other initiatives like Sagarmala which aims to improve connectivity to ports and reduce cargo dwell time and Bharatmala which focussed on improving road connectivity of major corridors have played a pivotal role in improving India’s logistics efficiency. The LPI index is a perception-based survey conducted across select stakeholders dealing with respective countries. *****\\nAD/VN\\n'),\n",

The meeting was chaired by the Special Secretary, Logistics Division, DPIIT, Ms. Sumita Dawra and saw active participation of senior officials from key member ministries/departments including Department of Telecommunication (DoT), M/o Environment, Forest and Climate Change, M/o Railways, M/o Ports, Shipping and Waterways, M/o Civil Aviation, M/o Power, NITI Aayog, M/o Road Transport and Highways, M/o Petroleum and Natural Gas and M/o New and Renewable Energy. During the meeting 4 projects by M/o Railways were examined by the NPG and recommended. These projects will be developed in tandem with the PM GatiShakti Principles using the integrated and holistic approach. These projects will also provide multimodal connectivity, seamless movement of goods and passengers as well as increase logistics efficiency across the country. A project by the Ministry of Railways for construction of Broad-gauge double line between Sawai Madhopur and Jaipur in Rajasthan state was examined by the NPG. The project spans approximately 131 kilometers from Sawai Madhopur to Jaipur and is deemed to be a significant infrastructure initiative. Upon completion, the project is expected to improve the line capacity to 71% (without maintenance block) and 80% (with maintenance block) by the year 2026-27. The Jaipur-Sawai Madhopur route serves as a feeder to the Delhi-Mumbai route, and it represents the primary conduit connecting Jaipur, its environs, and Mumbai, southern and eastern parts of India. The proposed project would help alleviate congestion in the existing single line network, resulting in uninterrupted traffic flow. Further, the National Planning Group (NPG) has evaluated a project proposed by the Ministry of Railways for the construction of a new Broad-gauge line between Anand Nagar Ghughuli via Maharajganj on Northeastern Railway in Uttar Pradesh state. The proposed project spans approximately 53 kilometers from Anand Nagar and would be constructed as a Broad Gauge (BG) Line. It is anticipated that the project would enhance economic development of the region by providing a direct B.G. route to the project area. The new line would serve as an alternate and shorter route for trains traveling from Valmikinagar to Gonda via Maharajganj without having to stop at Gorakhpur Junction. Passengers would benefit from this new line as the only transportation currently available in this section is by road. Additionally, the railway line is expected to facilitate the movement of cement, fertilizer, coal, and food grains, thus providing benefits to the related industries. Moreover, the railway line would enable freight movement to Nepal. Another project by the Ministry of Railways for construction new Broad-Gauge line between Junagarh to Nabarangpur station in Odisha state was examined by the NPG. The proposed project spans approximately 116 kilometers from Junagarh to Nabarangpur. The construction of this new line is expected to reduce the distance from Bailadela iron ore mines to various steel plants in the Raipur region by 131 kilometers. Additionally, it is anticipated that the project would facilitate the logistics of steel plant, and goods sheds at Junagarh Road, Jeypore, Koraput, and other goods sheds on the RV line, which are the points of multi-modal logistics. This new line would provide an alternative route for the movement of coal from Visakhapatnam, Gangavaram, and Kakinada ports to various steel plants in the Raipur region. The provision of road-rail intermodal logistics is expected to enhance traffic to goods sheds at Jeypore, Junagarh Road, and Nabarangpur. Last project by the Ministry of Railways was for Provision of Automatic Block Signaling on Freight Dense high utilization network on Western Railway. The project aims to cover 895 RKM and four major sections of Western Railway in Maharashtra & Gujarat State. The project will bring the balance freight dense High Utilization Network (HUN) Routes under the ambit of ABS, as ABS on High Density Network (HDN) routes of WR has already been sanctioned or exists. The benefit of the project includes enhanced line capacity and section speed to 130 kmph from 110 kmph that is likely to lead to cost reduction for the Railways and increase the overall logistics efficiency. This will result in a reduction of train detention and travel time, especially in the Udhna – Jalgaon, Ahmedabad – Palanpur, Ahmedabad- Viramgam- Samakhiyali, and Viramgam- Rajkot sections. Additionally benefits includes possible decongestion of road traffic and positive impact on the environment by reducing carbon footprint.

Commerce and Industry Minister highlighted the role of GeM as a digital tool in the public and national interest. GeM is a symbol of the speed with which PM Narendra Modi has taken the country forward through modern technology, said the Minister. He was speaking at a press conference on the landmark achievement of GeM. Mediapersons from various parts of the country also joined the press conference via video conferencing. Union Commerce and Industry Minister Shri Piyush Goyal congratulated GeM and its strong ecosystem of buyers and sellers, whose unwavering support has been pivotal towards achieving this historic feat. The Minister added that the Prime Minister desires that the Government departments run at the highest levels of integrity and transparency, with participation of people from the remotest corners of the country and enables women entrepreneuers, startups and the MSME sector to participate in a fair and equitable manner in government procurements. “I am confident that GeM will grow faster, the future is very bright. I would like to appeal to more and more vendors to join GeM so that they too get a chance to participate in the government procurement process”,\\xa0 he also said. After the GeM portal was launched in 2017, business worth about Rs 400 crore was done, and in the second year, GeM did business of about Rs 5800 crore. The business through GeM has grown from around Rs 35000 crore two years ago and tripled last year to Rs 1 lakh 6 thousand crores, the Minister informed.

A sense of stability is reflected in the foreign trade policy, he added. Speaking about the vision and journey ahead for GeM, CEO of GeM P.K. Singh, thanked all the stakeholders who are the primary drivers behind GeM\\'s reaching such great heights. As on 31st March 2023, GeM has recorded a staggering ₹ 2 lakh crore of Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) in FY 2022-23. Cumulatively, GeM has surpassed the ₹ 3.9 lakh crore GMV since inception, with the overwhelming support of its stakeholders. The total number of transactions on GeM has also crossed 1.47 crore. GeM is catering to the diverse procurement needs of over 67,000 government buyer organisations. The portal features over 11,700 product categories with more than 32 lakh listed products, as well as over 280 service categories with more than 2.8 lakh service offerings. Based on various studies, the minimum savings on the platform are about 10%, which translates into a savings of ~ ₹ 40,000 crore worth of public money. About Government e Marketplace (GeM)\\nGovernment e Marketplace (GeM) is an online platform for public procurement in India that was envisaged by the Prime Minister. The initiative was launched on August 9, 2016 by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry with the objective of creating an inclusive, efficient, and transparent platform for the buyers and sellers to carry out procurement activities in a fair and competitive manner. In the last ~6.5 years, GeM has revolutionized the ecosystem of public procurement in the country through technology, the digitization of processes, the digital integration of all stakeholders, and the use of analytics. GeM is an example of how digital platforms created with a strategic and clear intent to reinvigorate and reimagine legacy processes can bring about lasting change for the nation as well as the underserved. GeM has been effectively contributing to the government’s commitment of “Minimum Government, Maximum Governance”. The platform enables multiple procurement modes (direct purchase, L1 procurement, bidding, reverse auction, bid followed by reverse auction). GeM has evolved as a trust-based platform and is contactless, paperless, and cashless, where authentication of users is done through API integration with respective domain databases, i.e., Aadhaar, PAN, Startup, GSTN, MCA21, etc. The marketplace includes policies for automated market adjustments as well as end-to-end digital processes that support a thriving buyer-seller ecosystem. GeM has also developed many important functionalities in consultation with its stakeholders, like Push Button Procurement, Single Packet Bidding, Annual Procurement Plan, Vivaad Se Vishwaas, Business opportunities on GeM and AI/ML-based use cases for helping the buyers make more informed decisions. Through automation and digitization of processes, GeM has led to higher process efficiencies, better information sharing, improved transparency, reduced process cycle times, and a higher level of trust among bidders, which in turn have resulted in greater competition and higher savings.

The Minister said that he is optimistic about a significant growth of ONDC in the next few months. He invited all e-commerce companies, big and small, to join ONDC and be part of this new bazaar that reimagines digital commerce. He mentioned that ONDC will promote local languages, products, and cultural heritage, and create opportunities for small businesses. He said that small artisans and workers can offer better quality through ONDC and also earn better without having to pay commission for their products. He emphasized that ONDC will foster healthy competition, benefit consumers and contribute to the overall growth of the digital commerce ecosystem in India. He said that the Prime Minister believes that our ability to develop depends on our ability to leverage technology. He said that monolithic e-commerce platforms will never be able to provide the services of the kind that a network of platforms like ONDC can offer. The Minister highlighted the various sectors that may benefit from ONDC like farmers who can access bigger markets and demand better prices for their products, students who can compare prices of books and online courses, people who can avail health services at the best prices, etc. He emphasized on the need to create systems that benefit everyone and create opportunities for all. He said that the efforts are being undertaken to ensure that e-commerce becomes an engine of growth that empowers both buyers and sellers.

The Minister emphasized that India can only be defined as Bharat, as it thrives in villages and small habitations across the country. He mentioned that ONDC is targeting this ‘Bharat’ for inclusive growth, ensuring that the benefits of e-commerce reach every corner of the country. He said that the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi firmly believes in solving challenges the Indian way and trusts the people of India to come up with innovative solutions. He said that ONDC was born in such a manner when the e-commerce sector was grappling with multiple challenges and small businesses were under threat. He highlighted the need for alternate ways to address these challenges of the e-commerce ecosystem, while balancing the interests of small retailers and businesses led to the evolution of ONDC. The Minister outlined the unique features of ONDC, which aims to provide a win-win solution for both buyers and sellers. He said that ONDC, with its concept of using interfaces between various platforms, will open up more options for buyers, enhance price discovery and market opportunities for sellers, and also empower consumers to make informed choices. He said that this will result in more competition in the market and will not be limited through algorithms. He emphasized that ONDC will enable speedy, efficient, and real-time settlement of transactions, catering to hyperlocal and global needs simultaneously. During his address, the Minister said that ‘Enabling Bharat 2.0’ converges with the commitment of making India a developed nation by 2047 and it is desirable to plan for the future. He said that digital public infrastructure is the need of the hour. He said that all the efforts of the government have been citizen centric as was evident during the COVID pandemic with the development and production of vaccines and the launch of Co-WIN Vaccinator App to monitor the distribution of vaccines to everyone in the country. He cited the success of initiatives like the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in the financial services sector, which has brought about a transformational journey and encouraged hundreds of fintech companies to innovate and promote financial inclusion. He said that UPI has brought about innovation in the fintech sector at a pace never seen before and promoted startups and unicorns through socialising valuation. He drew parallels with ONDC, which is based on a similar concept of interoperable interface, opening up more options for buyers and creating more competition, while providing ease of operation for sellers across multiple platforms and also providing them a bigger market. The ‘Enabling Bharat 2.0’ workshop has been organized to find potential synergies and deepen collaboration among the various open protocol-enabled initiatives and generate awareness amongst multiple stakeholders. ***\\nAD/VN\\n'),\n",

Minister Delegate for Foreign Trade, Economic Attractiveness and French Nationals Abroad, Government of France, Mr Olivier Becht shared that he is confident that both sides will foster bilateral & multilateral meetings. “India being the world\\'s most populous country has the potential to attract numerous manufacturing activities, already, many French companies are actively engaged in India, and there is tremendous untapped potential for further collaboration”, he said. Vice-President, CII and Chairman & Managing Director, ITC Limited, Mr Sanjiv Puri shared that the presence of a large delegation from the CII in France underscores the significant importance that India attaches to its relationship with France. DG CII, Mr Chandrajit Banerjee highlighted that India and France are committed to collaborative engagement in areas like innovation, financial inclusion, ESG in businesses, and deepening global engagement towards Africa. Sessions were held on ‘Building a green future’; Critical and Emerging Technologies: The New Strategic Frontier; ‘Defence Cooperation: Securing a Shared Future Through Atmanirbhar Bharat’ and France and India: Springboard to Europe and Indo-Pacific. Builiding a Green Future\\nBoth India and France attach the highest importance to building a green future. Both countries have ambitious climate goals. Building a green future creates enormous market opportunities, but it also requires huge investments and technological breakthroughs. In recent years, there has been significant increase in investments, collaborations and joint ventures, especially from France to India, in “green technologies”. The Session brought out ways on how businesses could tap opportunities in green transition; discussed new technologies in various areas – renewable energy, mobility, buildings, infrastructure, construction, energy efficiency, industrial processes, agriculture. The Session was moderated by the Head of AFD Activities in Eastern Europe – Middle East and Asia, Mr Cyrille Bellier. Critical and Emerging Technologies: The New Strategic Frontier\\nCollaboration and competition are growing around critical and emerging technologies, including advanced computing, communications and networking technology, advanced materials, engine technology, space technologies and systems, sensors, renewable energy technology, semiconductors and microelectronics, directed energy, hypersonics, etc. As two countries with strong belief in sovereignty and strategic autonomy, the Session highlighted ways on how India and France can enhance their cooperation in critical and emerging technologies; complementarities between the two countries and opportunities therein; recommendations on increasing India-France Technology Cooperation. The Session was moderated by the Ambassador for Digital Affairs, Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs, Mr Henri Verdier. Defence Cooperation: Securing a Shared Future Through Atmanirbhar Bharat\\nThe evolving geopolitics, including the growing challenges in the Indo Pacific region, and emergence of contests in new domains such as Space and cyberspace, have further increased the salience of this partnership. France has been a longstanding and an increasingly important source of defence platforms, equipment and technology for India. The Session brought out how we go beyond assembly and also develop and design defence technologies; specific defence platforms and equipment where we see maximum potential for India-France partnership. The Session was moderated by DG, CII, Mr Chandrajit Banerjee. France and India: Springboard to Europe and Indo-Pacific\\nIn the past three years, France has been ranked the most attractive investment destination in the EU, which is also reflected in the rising foreign investment figures. While India is among the leading Asian sources of investments in France, the value of investments is small and concentrated in a few sectors. Indian companies are reviewing their European strategy in the context of the post-Brexit EU. France could be the next big destination for Indian investments. Since generating a part of the value in the market is important for success, the Session shed light on how can Indian companies invest more in France to cater to India’s largest destination for exports, the EU; and on how markets can be accessed. The Session was chaired by President, FIEO, Mr A Sakthivel. CEOs Roundtable\\nMore than 50 CEOs from Indian and French companies participated at the CEOs Roundtable which was addressed by Union Minister of Commerce & Industry, Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution and Textiles, Shri Piyush Goyal and the Minister Delegate for Foreign Trade, Economic Attractiveness and French Nationals Abroad, Government of France, Mr Olivier Becht.

Earlier, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), through its letter dated 13.09.2021, had requested TRAI to provide recommendations on “Auction of spectrum in the frequencies\\xa0\\xa0 identified for International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) / 5G”. Through the said letter, TRAI was also requested to provide recommendations, inter-alia, on appropriate frequency bands, band plan, block size, applicable reserve price, quantum of spectrum to be auctioned and associated conditions for auction of spectrum for space-based communication services. In this regard, TRAI through letters dated 27.09.2021 and 23.11.2021, sought information/ clarifications in respect of space-based communication services from DoT. In response, DoT through the letter dated 27.11.2021 informed, inter-alia, that the information in respect of space-based communication services sought by TRAI will take some time; therefore, to avoid delay in 5G roll-out, TRAI may go ahead with consultations/ recommendations on issues excluding space-based communication services referred in DoT's reference dated 13.09.2021 and 23.09.2021. DoT also mentioned that the issues related to space-based communication services may be taken up separately on receipt of information from DoT. Subsequently, TRAI gave its recommendations to the Government on ‘Auction of Spectrum in frequency bands identified for IMT/5G’ on 11.04.2022. Thereafter, DoT through letter dated 16.08.2022 provided information with respect to space-based communication services as sought by TRAI through the letters dated 27.09.2021 and 23.11.2021. While providing the requisite information, DoT requested TRAI to provide recommendations on certain additional issues, as mentioned below:\\n(a) TRAI, through consultations, may assess the demand for space-based communication services and accordingly provide recommendations on the quantum of spectrum in each band required to be put to auction. (b) It is envisaged to auction the Space Spectrum on exclusive basis. TRAI may explore feasibility and procedure of sharing auctioned spectrum among multiple service licensees. TRAI may provide recommendations on sharing of auctioned frequency bands between satellite networks and terrestrial networks also, the criteria for sharing and appropriate interference mitigation techniques for sharing and coexistence. (c) In frequency bands 27.5-28.5 GHz (identified for IMT) and 28.5-29.5 GHz (being studied for Captive Non-Public Networks), TRAI may recommend mechanism for sharing of auctioned frequency bands in which both IMT/ CNPN and satellite-based services (both user terminal and Gateways) can be provided in a flexible manner. (d) Since the service providers may require spectrum both in user link as well as in feeder link, TRAI may take inputs from the stakeholders and recommend the appropriate auction methodology so that the successful bidder gets spectrum for user link (shared with IMT in flexible) as well as feeder link. (e) In addition, TRAI is requested to provide any other recommendations as deemed fit for the purpose of spectrum auction in these frequency bands, including the regulatory/ technical requirements as enunciated in the relevant provisions of the latest ITU-R Radio Regulations. Subsequently, TRAI, through the letter dated 19.10.2022 to DoT, sought further information/ clarifications, wherein DoT was requested, inter-alia, to clarify that for which kind of licensed services, spectrum for space-based communication has been envisaged to be granted through Auction. In response, DoT, through the letter dated 16.12.2022, conveyed that TRAI may provide suitable recommendations for each of the space-based communication services after detailed examination. Hence, in the present consultation paper, TRAI has considered all the spectrum bands relevant for space-based communication services as indicated by DoT. In this regard, a Consultation Paper on “Assignment of Spectrum for Space-based Communication Services”, seeking inputs from stakeholders have been placed on TRAI’s website (www.trai.gov.in). In this consultation paper, specific issues have been raised for consideration of stakeholders. Written comments on the issues raised in the Consultation Paper are invited from the stakeholders by 4th May 2023 and counter-comments by 18th May 2023. The comments/counter-comments may be sent, preferably in electronic form at advmn@trai.gov.in.

The TRAI notified regulation on quality of service of dial-up and leased line internet access service, 2001 (4 of 2001) on 10th December 2001. This regulation is applicable to all the Basic Service Operators and Internet Service Providers, including the incumbent operators viz. BSNL, MTNL and VSNL. The purpose of laying down Quality of Service Parameters was to ensure customer satisfaction by laying down norms of network performance, which the service provider is required to achieve by proper dimensioning of his network; measure the Quality of Service from time to time and to compare that with the specified norms so as to monitor the level of performance, provided by various service providers and to protect the interests of subscribers of the Internet services. It has been noticed that these regulations were issued when the dial up service was the only service available for accessing low speed internet. With the passage of time, the telecommunication networks both wireline as well as wireless have evolved to offer high speed broadband service on xDSL, FTTH, LTE, etc, technologies. Whereas the leased line access services are generally offered by Internet Gateway Service Providers (IGSPs) holding an ISP licence to enterprises, is a Service Level Agreement (SLA) based service. Being SLA based service, the agreement among the contracting parties has sufficient provisions to safeguard concerns regarding service quality. Hence, the regulation on quality of service of dial-up and leased line internet access service, 2001, appears to be no more relevant in the present context. In view of the above, Authority intends to repeal the Regulation on quality of service of dial-up and leased line internet access service, 2001 (4 of 2001) with effect from date of its notification in Official Gazette. The draft Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Repealing Regulations, 2022 regulation is available on TRAI website www.trai.gov.in and shall be open for comments of the stakeholders up to 17th April 2023.

Recent media reports have highlighted the challenges faced by the people living near the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in accessing high-speed internet, which is critical for pursuing online education and accessing digital banking. Furthermore, many remote areas in Ladakh lack mobile towers, resulting in network issues, particularly for those residing near the LAC and the Line of Control (LoC). As these areas are of strategic importance, mobile connectivity is crucial for ensuring the safety of the region by facilitating round-the-clock communication to the security forces deployed in these regions. The TRAI obtained the current status of mobile network coverage and backhaul infrastructure layout data in the UT of Ladakh from operating TSPs, as well as details of ongoing USOF sponsored telecom projects and Optical Ground Wire (OPGW) infrastructure availability from Power Distribution Companies (DISCOMs). Based on the gap analysis and evaluation of the Government sponsored USOF schemes, TRAI has come up with recommendations on “Improving Telecom Coverage and Backhaul Infrastructure in far-flung areas of Ladakh”.

In RMS 2022-23, the procurement was 188 LMT. However, till April 26th, 2023, wheat procurement during RMS 2023-24 is 195 LMT. This has largely benefitted the farmers. MSP outflow of about Rs. 41148 crores has already been made to about 14.96 lakh farmers during the ongoing wheat procurement operations. Notably, major contribution in the procurement comes from three wheat procuring states of Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh with procurement of 89.79 LMT, 54.26 LMT and 49.47 LMT respectively. One of the major factors, contributing the progressive procurement this year, is the grant of relaxation by GOI in quality specifications of wheat being procured, in view of untimely rains leading to luster loss. This will reduce the hardship of farmers and check any distress sale. The Central Government has also allowed all the states to open procurement centres at village/ panchayat level and to carry out the procurement through Co-operative Societies/ Gram Panchayats/ Arhatias etc. also in addition to already existing designated procurement centres, for better outreach. In addition, rice procurement is also progressing smoothly. A quantity of 354 LMT of rice has been procured till 26.04.2023 during kharif crop of KMS 2022-23 with another 140 LMT yet to be procured. Further, a quantity of 106 LMT rice has been estimated to be procured during the Rabi crop of KMS 2022-23. The combined stock position of wheat and rice in the Central Pool, has surpassed 510 LMT which puts the country in a comfortable position to meet its requirements of food grains.

In this regard, Secretary, Department of Consumer Affairs, Shri Rohit Kumar Singh took an internal meeting with these officers who visited major pulses markets and interacted with various market players. During the last week, apart from holding a meeting with All India Dal Mills Association at Indore by the Secretary, Government of India, on 15th April, 2023, the Department deputed 12 senior officers to visit various places in the States of Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu to take stock of ground reality. The interactions with ground level market players and State officials revealed that while the number of registration and stock disclosure on the e-portal is increasing, substantial number of market players have either not registered or failed to update their stock positions on regular basis. It has been observed that stocks under transaction, like, farmer’s stocks lying in mandi for auction, stocks awaiting customs clearance at ports etc. escaped the current monitoring mechanism. Further, it has also been observed that millers and traders/dealers have resorted to holding their stocks in warehouses in the name of farmers in a deliberate attempt to escape stock declaration. Senior officers of the Department visited various locations, namely,Indore, Chennai, Salem, Mumbai, Akola, Latur, Sholapur, Kalaburagi, Jabalpur and Katni and interacted with officers of the State Governments, millers, traders, importers and port authorities and conducted meeting with associations of millers, importers and traders. The market players were sensitized on the importance of stock declaration and have been asked to declare their stocks truthfully and regularly or else stringent action such as seizure and confiscation of undeclared stocks may be done by the State Government. The office bearers of Importers association informed that Traders from other States like Telengana, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka are also importing Tur Dal from Chennai Port and requested clarification about their reporting in the State of Importers or in the State of receiving the import to ensure no duplication of data.It was clarified that the stocks should be reported in the State where it is physically available/stocked. The Department has already directed State Governments and District Administrations to intensify the enforcement of stock declaration by conducting stock verification and take strict action on undisclosed stocks under relevant sections of the EC Act, 1955 and the Prevention of Black marketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act, 1980. States have also been asked to look into the data pertaining to FSSAI licences, APMC registration, GST registration, warehouses and custom bonded warehouses and encourage these entities also to report their declarations of stock in order to widen the coverage of market players. To improve the stock disclosure data, the Department is making certain changes in the e-portal https://fcainfoweb.nic.in/psp/ such as, incorporating text boxes for providing warehouse in which stock is held, provision for dealer/commission agent/mandi trader to upload stock data of farmer lying in his shop yard for auctioning etc. Further, the Department has been in touch with Customs to take necessary action on importers who have deliberately delayed clearance of their consignments. The Department affirms its intention to sustain the efforts on monitoring the stocks of Tur and Urad.

The conference had participation of a diverse group of stakeholders, including government officials, \\xa0Chairman of RERA, Delhi, Chairman MahaRERA, Officials\\xa0 from MOHUA, IBBI, legal experts, industry leaders, and consumer rights activists, to identify actionable solutions to the pressing issues faced by homebuyers and builders in the real estate sector. Several topics related to real estate were covered during the conference, such as systemic policy interventions to reduce litigation in the housing sector, the reasons for the high number of cases filed before Consumer Commissions despite the existence of separate authorities like RERA specifically for housing sector cases, and ensuring effective and timely resolution of housing sector cases. The Secretary of the Department of Consumer Affairs for the Government of India, Rohit Kumar Singh, in his address, highlighted the staggering number of pending cases in the housing sector at different consumer Commissions. Out of over 5.5 lakh cases currently awaiting resolution, over 54,000 cases\\xa0 related to housing sector. This backlog of cases highlights the importance of providing speedy justice and streamlining the process for homebuyers. To address these challenges, the Secretary suggested implementing a simple, model buyer agreement that could help to streamline the homebuying process and protect consumers from potential abuses. This agreement could help to reduce disputes between homebuyers and builders and ensure that consumers have access to effective, speedy, hassle-free, and inexpensive grievance redressal mechanisms. The Secretary, Department of Consumer Affairs, also highlighted the significance of the Consumer Protection Act 2019, which recognizes housing construction as a service and categorizes developers as product sellers. This recognition helps to ensure that homebuyers have access to the same consumer protections that they would receive when purchasing any other type of product or service. It was also highlighted the need for continued focus on the housing sector in India, particularly when it comes to protecting consumers and streamlining the homebuying process. By implementing measures like model buyer agreements and effective grievance redressal mechanisms, the backlog of cases can be redressed and ensure that homebuyers are treated fairly and protected from potential abuses, he stated. Additional Secretary, Department of Consumer Affairs, Govt of India, Nidhi Khare, in a detailed presentation outlined a comprehensive overview of the legal provisions under various statutes designed to protect the interests of homebuyers. She delved into the roles and responsibilities of homebuyers under the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA), Consumer Protection Act, 2019, and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. The presentation also addressed the increasing number of cases filed by homebuyers and the impact of these disputes on both homebuyers and builders, leading to distrust within the sector. During the conference, Member NCDRC, Binoy Kumar, underscored the importance of the builder-buyer agreement as the fundamental document governing transactions in the real estate sector. He suggested that the buyer agreement should be made more efficient and in line with Supreme Court orders, which would subsequently reduce the number of cases filed by homebuyers. During the conference, several key takeaways emerged as crucial points of discussion. The prevalence of real estate cases in consumer commissions led to suggestions for utilizing similar judgments to expedite the legal process and encouraging parties to engage in discussions to resolve disputes amicably. The success of conciliation in resolving disputes was emphasized, urging for better cooperation between consumer courts and RERA to prioritize conciliation over litigation. The importance of completing and distributing incomplete projects, rather than opting for insolvency under IBC, was stressed, along with a call for transparency among all stakeholders. Insights were also provided on misleading advertisements in the real estate sector, emphasizing the need for enhanced transparency between buyers and developers to avoid future legal disputes.

Several dignitaries including Secretary, Ministry of Cooperation, Shri Gyanesh Kumar, and Chairman, IFFCO, Shri Dilip Sanghani were present on the occasion. In his address, Shri Amit Shah said that the launch of IFFCO Nano DAP (Liquid) product is an important beginning to make India self-reliant in the field of fertilizers. He said that this effort of IFFCO is an inspiration for all the national cooperatives to research and venture into new areas. He expressed confidence that under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the launch of IFFCO Nano DAP (Liquid) product will bring a paradigm shift in the agriculture sector of India, it will make farmers prosperous and India self-reliant in the field of production and fertilizer. Shri Shah said that the use of liquid DAP, through spraying on the plant, will help increase both the quality and quantity of production as well in conservation of the land. This will contribute a lot in restoring the fertility of land and will reduce the threat to the health of crores of Indians caused by the chemical fertilizers. Union Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation Minister Shri Amit Shah appealed farmers to use more effective liquid Nano Urea and DAP instead of granular urea and DAP. He said that the use of granular urea damages the land as well as the crop and the health of the people. He said\\xa0 that farmers have the maximum capacity to accept any new changes. The effect of one bottle of 500 ml on the crop is equivalent to that of 45 kg bag of granular urea. Due to it being a liquid, the land will be minimally contaminated by chemicals. Earthworms themselves work like a fertilizer factory when they are in good quantity. He said that by using liquid DAP and liquid urea, the farmers can increase the number of earthworms in their land and move towards natural farming without reducing production and income. This will also help in conserving the land. Shri Shah said that in a country like India, where 60 percent of the population is still associated with agriculture and its related businesses, this revolutionary step will take agriculture a long way in the coming days and make India self-sufficient in the field of food production and fertilizers. Shri Amit Shah said that 384 lakh metric tonnes of fertilizer is produced in the country, out of which cooperative societies produced 132 lakh metric tonnes. Out of this 132 Lakh metric tonnes of fertilizer, IFFCO has produced 90 Lakh metric tonnes. He said that cooperative societies like IFFCO, KRIBHCO have a huge contribution in India's self-reliance in the fields of fertilizer, milk production and marketing. Shri Shah said that instead of mass production, the main mantra of the cooperation is “mass production by masses”. It was believed that this mantra could not be successful after the decade of 1970-80, but, many cooperative societies like IFFCO and KRIBHCO have followed this mantra. Along with their professionalism in every field of cooperation, research, capacity and capability, they have kept the spirit of co-operative alive and have implemented it on the ground. He said that the biggest example and success story of a cooperative is that if today IFFCO earns Rupee 1, after the\\xa0 deduction of income tax, 80 paise goes directly to the farmers. The Union Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation said that after the introduction of liquid Nano DAP and liquid Nano Urea, due to the efforts of IFFCO, the first Nano DAP (Liquid) has been launched in the world today. He said that IFFCO has registered a patent, under which IFFCO will get 20% royalty on the sale of Liquid Urea and Liquid DAP anywhere in the world for 20 years which is revolutionary step. Shri Amit Shah said that IFFCO has done extraordinary work in taking scientific research to the agriculture fields through 'Lab to Land' approach. In this series, cooperative society IFFCO has commissioned three urea plants in a single year. The Union Minister orf Cooperation said that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi had given approval to Nano Urea on February 24, 2021 and today in 2023 the infrastructure to make about 17 crore Nano Urea bottles has been set up. Marketing of Nano Urea started in August 2021 and about 6.3 crore bottles have been manufactured till March 2023. Due to this, the consumption and import has been reduced\\xa0 by 6.3 crore urea bags and helped in saving the country's revenue and foreign currency. This is a very revolutionary step and a great success story. The Union Home Minister\\xa0 and Minister of Cooperation Minister said that the import of urea in the country has also decreased by seven lakh metric tonnes in 2021-22. He said that a goal has been set to reduce the usage of granular DAP by about 90 lakh metric tons through liquid DAP. 18 crore liquid DAP bottles will be produced in the country. Shri Shah said that potato growing farmers of Punjab, Haryana, West Bengal, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh used about 8 bags of DAP per acre of land, which increased the production but polluted the land and the farm produce. He said liquid DAP contains 8 per cent nitrogen and 16 per cent phosphorous. Its application will help reduce usage of granular urea by about 14% and that of DAP initially by 6% and later by 20%. It will lead to saving in foreign exchange reserves of the country, improvement in plant nutrition and 100% availability of nutrients in the soil. Along with this, there will be a reduction in the expenditure incurred by the farmers, that of around 6% in wheat and about 20% reduction in the production of potato and sugarcane. This will not only improve the fertility of the land, but will also be beneficial for the health of the consumer. Shri Amit Shah said that during the Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi constituted the Ministry of Cooperation to revive, strengthen and to make the cooperative sector dynamic. We are bringing many changes in the cooperative sector. Shri Shah said that in order to strengthen the cooperative sector, the Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) will have to be strengthened first. For this, the Ministry of Cooperation has decided that in the next 5 years, new multi-dimensional PACS will be created in 2 lakh panchayats of the country. For these, 32 different types of services like dairy, arrangement for giving agricultural loans to farmers, fishermen cooperative, IFFCO dealership, fair price grains shop, common service center, water management committee will be identified. Shri Shah said that the model bye-laws of PACS have been sent to the states and 17 states have also adopted these model bye-laws. He said that under the Multidimensional PACS, a single PACS would be created by combining four PACS providing multi-usage services, fisheries, providing financial loans to farmers and dairy. This will rejuvenate the PACS and also help improve their income. The Union Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation said that 80% of the people in India are associated with cooperatives and we are going to make it multi-dimensional in true sense. IFFCO has used its experience and confidence to take forward this entire cooperative movement which is necessary to strengthen the cooperative sector. IFFCO has focused on expansion of distribution network, enhancement of digital transactions, diversity and stability in product portfolio, capacity building and R&D. Shri Shah said that the Government of India has formed three multi-state co-operative societies related to organic products, seeds and exports, in which IFFCO is a leading investor and all these three societies will benefit from the experience of IFFCO. ****\\nRK/AY/AKS/AS\\n\"),\n",

Our constitution and democratic structure significantly accord a system for social Justice to all the citizens.

He also highlighted the trusteeship principle of Mahatma Gandhi and welfare of people. He informed about some of the initiatives of NHRC in different sectors relevant to BHR such as advisory for truck drivers, differently-abled, etc. He stressed on exploring more synergies between NHRC and IICA to strengthen the BHR agenda in country. Shri Praveen Kumar, DG&CEO, IICA said that IICA being an eminent Govt. institute focuses on the multiple areas of corporate affairs and School of Business Environment at IICA has launched this unique first of its kind programme on Business and Human Rights to help corporate professionals build specific knowledge and capabilities to translate human rights requirements into concrete strategies and practical actions.

Business and Human Rights related disclosures under the UNGC, GRI, NGRBC, and BRSR etc. are of utmost importance for a business to not only carry an image of a responsible business among its stakeholders but also for ensuring social sustainability. Today, various stakeholders of business like investors, consumers, communities, shareholders etc. demand business to be responsible and avoid human rights violations, and take measures to protect and respect human rights. He said that making mere disclosures may not be considered as transparency, disclosures are only one of the components of transparency.

The webinar will reflect on the importance of living heritage and on its role towards sustainability, bringing together experts from 29 countries including G20 members and guest nations, as well as several international organizations. The objective of this webinar is to foster an inclusive dialogue and facilitate an in-depth discussion from an expert driven perspective on harnessing living heritage for a sustainable future. It seeks to promote knowledge sharing; capitalize on the best practices and experiences; identify gaps, needs, and opportunities in harnessing living heritage practices. The webinar will also inform the reflection of the G20 membership in formulating tangible and action-oriented outcomes.

It will be live streamed on the YouTube channel of UNESCO (Paris). Living heritage is an embodiment of social practices, traditions, and knowledge passed down through generations that reflect a community's history, identity, and values. It serves as social capital for communities, providing a sense of shared identity, fostering social cohesion, and promoting cultural continuity across generations. Many of these practices prioritize the use and reuse of natural resources, contributing to waste reduction and maintenance of a balance between social, economic, and environmental factors, thus contributing to sustainability. However, these traditional practices face the threat of misuse and of cultural appropriation of elements, design or knowledge of indigenous communities by transnational companies. Further, owing to limited research in the area, as well as due to the absence of community groups' participation, the significance of these practices and knowledge systems has not been fully acknowledged. The following global thematic webinars on priority three and four are scheduled for 19th and 20th April respectively. ****\\nNB/SK\\n\"),\n",

The webinar will reflect on the current trends, challenges, and opportunities of the cultural and creative industries, bringing together experts from G20 members and guest nations, as well as relevant international organisations. Organised by the Ministry of Culture, Government of India, the webinar is being hosted and facilitated by UNESCO (Paris), knowledge partner of CWG. The cultural and creative industries and creative economy, play a significant role in shaping our global landscape, contributing 3.1% to the worldwide Gross Domestic Product. This substantial economic impact contributes to the enrichment of our social and cultural fabric. Notably, the cultural and creative sector employs more people in the age group of 15-29, compared to any other and therefore demonstrates a strong potential for fostering youth employment. Although the cultural sector makes a substantial contribution to the global economy, its long-term growth is hindered by the absence of a standard definition of the creative economy and insufficient collection of cultural data contributing to its informal nature. Today, 60% of the global creative economy is informal. These challenges not only affect the status of cultural practitioners but also have greater impacts on the larger economy. The objective of this webinar is to foster an inclusive dialogue and facilitate an in-depth discussion from an expert driven perspective on promoting cultural and creative industries and creative economy. It seeks to encourage knowledge sharing; capitalise on the best practices and experiences; identify gaps, needs, and opportunities for increasing the creative economy’s share in the global GDP and improving cultural data collection for the creation of satellite accounts for the sector, a key step towards its formalisation. Being a subset of the national accounts, these will help better understand the economic impact of the sector and provide policy-makers with comprehensive data for developing policies and strategies that promote the growth and development of the sector. The webinar will also inform the reflection of the G20 membership in formulating tangible outcomes. It will have three speaking segments and experts will be distributed across these segments based on their respective time zones.

The webinar is the last in the series of the four organised by the Ministry of Culture, Government of India, which is being facilitated by UNESCO (Paris), as a knowledge partner of CWG. The webinar is scheduled for 20 April 2023, from 12:30 PM to 8:30 PM (IST), with the intent to foster an inclusive dialogue and initiate an in-depth discussion from an expert driven perspective on the priority area articulated by the CWG and supported by the G20 membership. The aim is to discuss the digital upskilling and capacity building of cultural practitioners and sharing of best practices to digitise cultural heritage assets for long term preservation by experts from G20 members, guest nations, and relevant international organisations. At the global thematic webinar, experts would also discuss the impact of emerging technologies and the new opportunities they present to memory institutions for reaching wider audiences and engage them in novel and immersive ways. These include artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality and robotics among others. Artificial intelligence, for instance, can help memory institutions analyse and categorise vast amounts of data, making it easier to organise and access digital archives. Virtual and augmented reality technologies can create immersive experiences that enable visitors to interact with historical artefacts and cultural heritage sites in a more engaging and personalised way. Robotics can be used to create replicas of artifacts and cultural objects, enabling their preservation and dissemination beyond the physical boundaries of the institution. However, the constantly evolving nature of digital technologies also presents challenges for memory institutions, particularly in the areas of digital preservation. This challenge requires an agile, context-specific, and global framework for the digitisation and digitalisation of culture. The potential of emerging technologies to transform the way we engage with culture is immense, and memory institutions need to be proactive in leveraging these technologies to achieve their mission of preserving and disseminating cultural heritage by exploring opportunities for collaboration among the various stakeholders for digitalisation and digitisation of culture, especially with private technology firms. The upcoming webinar will consist of three speaking segments, specifically designed to explore and discuss significant aspects of the theme - Leveraging digital technologies for the protection and promotion of culture. These segments will aim to facilitate knowledge sharing and exchange of good practices, identify gaps and priorities, and provide recommendations to the CWG. The webinar will have three speaking segments and experts will be distributed across these segments based on their respective time zone.

This webinar was the third in a series of four that focus on the priority areas as articulated by the CWG. The aim of the webinar was to foster an inclusive dialogue and facilitate an in-depth discussion from an expert driven perspective. The webinar was held\\xa0 from 12.30 pm to 8:30 pm (IST) on 19th April.It witnessed fruitful discussions and sharing of best practices on promotion of cultural and creative industries and creative economy, bringing together 43 experts from 28 countries including G20 members and guest nations, as well as 13 international organisations and relevant institutions. In today's globalised world, the vital role of cultural and creative industries and the creative economy in an international economic context cannot be overstated. These industries have become drivers of growth, as seen in the global exports of creative goods and services, which reached US$524 million and US$1.1 trillion, respectively, in 2020, according to the Creative Economy Outlook 2022 by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. This trend is expected to continue in the coming years. The engagement of the youth in cultural and creative industries is noteworthy as the sector employs the largest number of people in the age group of 15-29. In the context of South-South trade, the cultural and creative industries are increasingly important as a source of continued economic growth and development. In the last two decades, South-South trade in creative goods has doubled, comprising 40.5% of creative exports of developing economies in 2020. Additionally, since 2011, developing economies have exported more creative goods than developed economies. Although the creative industry holds a great deal of importance, its persistent informal structure presents a significant obstacle to achieving sustainable growth. Currently, the informal economy accounts for an estimated 60 percent of the global creative industry, impacting the status of cultural practitioners and having far-reaching consequences for the broader economy. The contributions of this sector are undervalued, making it essential to establish a cohesive network to address these challenges. To do so, it is crucial to promote international collaboration, enabling critical deliberation on necessary measures towards formalisation. Govind Mohan, Secretary, Ministry of Culture and Chair, CWG in his opening remarks at the webinar emphasised\\xa0 “fostering a vibrant and inclusive cultural ecosystem that values and supports creativity can have positive impacts on individuals, communities, and society. The cultural and creative sector is also a catalyst for change, empowering individuals, and communities, promoting freedom of expression and cross-cultural dialogue. It is, therefore, essential to support this sector and establish an environment where creativity and innovation can thrive.”\\nThe webinar had three speaking segments and the interventions by experts were distributed across these segments based on their respective time zones. The webinar was moderated successively by representatives of ILO, UNCTAD, and WIPO with expertise on the topic. It was live streamed on the YouTube channel of UNESCO. At the webinar, representatives from the G20, guest nations, and international organisations shared data demonstrating the substantial contribution of the creative economy to their respective national GDPs. Certain interventions emphasised that the creative economy also serves as the basis for a unified, human-centered society that upholds cultural diversity as a fundamental principle. The discussion specifically highlighted the transformative changes brought about by the digital revolution, and more recently, by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in relation to emerging business models and cutting-edge technologies. Several countries indicated that the cultural and creative industries have increasingly become a core priority, as evidenced by the establishment of dedicated ministries in some cases. A number of countries have implemented policies aimed at improving the status of cultural practitioners, promoting fairness in compensation, and enhancing inclusivity and equity in the cultural sector. In addition, these countries are investing in formal education, professionalisation, and talent development to create more jobs in the cultural sector and are working to improve data collection in the creative sector, including through culture satellite accounts. A set of recommendations were made regarding the methodologies used to classify the creative sector. Some of these emphasised the need to establish a clear and unified definition of the scope of the creative economy, drawing on internationally agreed definitions and examples from specific national cultural policies. Other recommendations called for a focus on measuring the creative sector's contribution to GDP and its impact on sustainable development in G20 countries, in collaboration with specialised international organisations, building upon their existing statistical and methodological frameworks. A consolidated report of the four global thematic webinars will be produced and shared with G20 members, guest nations and international organisations at the third CWG meeting due in Hampi, Karnataka from 15 July to 18 July 2023. The aim of this report is to serve as legacy of the joint work, deliberations and discussions of the CWG process, with a view to ensure knowledge building over time.

The focus of the lecture was on the religious and spiritual overtones in Nehru. According to Shri Arif Mohammad Khan, contrary to popular perceptions, Jawaharlal Nehru was deeply influenced by religion and spirituality in a higher sense, both in his youth and later years, and that it was mainly the ritualistic aspects of religion from which he largely stayed away. He felt that much of the misunderstanding arises from Nehru’s self-confessed agnosticism and his emphasis on offloading baggage of tradition in order to modernize. Citing letters written by him to Mahatma Gandhi in 1922 from the Naini jail, Shri Khan highlighted how during this period Pandit Nehru was absorbed in the reading of the Gita, the Upanishads, and the Ramayana. If we consider nishkaama karma or action without desire for fruits is the highest religion as preached by the Gita, argued Sri Khan, then Nehru was a deeply religious man, as all his life he practised this philosophy for the good of others. Shri Khan asserted that translating Dharma as religion is one of the principal factors behind the inability to understand people like Nehru and the Indian culture and civilization which has seen all existence as one. Taking examples from the Discovery of India and other texts also, the Governor asserted that Nehru was deeply in love with Indian culture and civilization and believed that Sanskrit language and inheritance was at the core of our civilization without which India could not even survive, let alone flourish. Quoting copiously from the Gita, the Upanishads and other texts, Shri Khan showed the highly nuanced relationship Nehru had with these texts and with religion in general. The lecture was part of the academic initiatives of Pradhanmantri Sangrahalaya. The inaugural lecture of the Prime Ministers Lecture Series was delivered on 20 January 2023 by former President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind. The Pradhanmantri Sangrahalaya is a tribute to every Prime Minister of India since Independence, and a narrative record of how each one has contributed to the development of our nation over the last 75 years. It is a history of collective effort, and powerful evidence of the creative success of India’s democracy. The Pradhanmantri Sangrahalaya which was opened for the public in April last year has emerged as one of the top tourist destinations of Delhi. In this one year i.e., from 21 April 2022 to 20 April 2023 i.e., the date it was opened by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, approximately 3.5 lakh people have visited the Sangrahalaya. ****\\nNB/SK\\n\\n'),\n",

Aim: In the present world scenario, the human race has been in great need to be free from conflict, ill-feeling, greed, selfishness and uncertainty of life. We are in dire need of peace and harmony both, in our personal life and at the global level. The texts, doctrines and philosophy of Buddha Dhamma are best\\xa0 guide for inter-faith dialogue, harmony and universal peace. 2.

Prime Minister Sri Narendra Modi ji has led from the front in ensuring that the country’s rich civilizational history gets its due recognition globally. The Modi government is deeply aware of the nation’s rich culture and has taken much-needed steps for preserving our heritage. From added impetus on preservation of monuments to establishing world class institutes that train our citizens on conservation strategies, the government has done a slew of initiatives to maintain our cultural assets. The government has also built many monuments of national importance to give our young generation a richer sense of Indian history”. On the occasion of world heritage day, the Union Minister Shri G Kishan Reddy tweeted and urged the citizens to preserve our heritage for future generations.

Let's preserve our heritage for future generations pic.twitter.com/edpiFDAs3g\\nThe Government of India has taken several steps to preserve ancient civilisational ethos, protect cultural and spiritual heritage and propagate Indian Knowledge systems and traditions across the world. Bringing Our Gods Home is one such initiative that is rooted in preserving, promoting and propagating our heritage. While speaking on the efforts being made, the Union Minister said, “The impact of the Government’s focus on India’s heritage is clearly visible with tangible outputs and outcomes. Since 2014, more than 230 antiquities have been repatriated; Of the total 244 invaluable antiquities of Indian origin that\\xa0 have been brought back to India from abroad, 231 have been brought back after 2014. Close to 72 antiquities are in the process of being repatriated from various countries including the USA, UK, Singapore and Australia. On numerous foreign visits, our Prime Minister has discussed this matter with global leaders and multilateral institutions and today, innumerable countries are themselves reaching out to India to send back stolen artefacts and antiquities”. In 1982, the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) announced 18 April as World Heritage Day. This was approved by the General Assembly of UNESCO in 1983, to enhance awareness about the importance of cultural heritage, and monuments and conserving them. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) has a total of 1,154 monuments designated as world heritage sites from all over the world. Apart from India only Italy, Spain, Germany, China and France have 40 or more World Heritage sites. On the increase in sites from India to UNESCO's world heritage sites, the Union Minister said, “Out of 40 World Heritage Inscriptions, 10 have been done in the last 9 years with a wide range of diversity from across India. India’s Tentative List has increased by 37 from 2014 to 2022, from 15 in 2014 to 52 in 2022. This provides huge potential to India to attract a large number of foreign travellers to India. Considering that 52 more sites are on India’s World Heritage Tentative list, our heritage monuments will play a huge role in transforming the tourism sector”. After many decades’ various sites of civilizational significance have been redeveloped and revived through the efforts of the Narendra Modi government. Speaking on the work done to ensure world class amenities in all the spiritual heritage locations the Union Minister said, “Continuous focus has been given on the revival and redevelopment of heritage sites across India. Numerous such examples are like the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor and various other projects in Varanasi which have transformed the by lanes, ghats, and temple complexes in the city. In fact, this is the first transformational project in Kashi in close to 250 years since Ahilybhai Holkar in 1777. The 900 km Char Dham road project which will provide seamless all weather road connectivity to the four holy Dhams of Kedarnath, Badrinath, Yamunotri and Gangotri. The Somnath Temple reconstruction project,The Ujjain Mahakal Corridor and the ongoing Ram Mandir construction in Ayodhya, are other examples where we are\\xa0 redeveloping our spiritual heritage”. The Government of India, has been focussing on preserving the Buddhist heritage and taking the message of Lord Buddha across the world. While speaking on promoting buddhist heritage, the Union Minister Shri G Kishan Reddy said, “The Prime Minister has taken it as his dharma to strengthen India’s ties with countries sharing Lord Buddha’s heritage. Our government is developing Buddhist Circuits with world class infrastructure to ensure a wholesome spiritual experience for devotees. In November 2021, our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji inaugurated the Kushinagar International Airport in Uttar Pradesh to facilitate easy access to the Mahaparinirvana Temple, where Lord Buddha attained nirvana. In May 2022, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji laid the foundation stone for a technologically-advanced India International Centre for Buddhist Culture and Heritage in Lumbini at a cost of 100 crore at the Lord Buddha’s birthplace. The Ministry of Tourism is developing the Buddhist circuit around Kushinagar Sravasti and Kapilvastu as a part of the SWADESH Darshan scheme.Overall, several projects for the development of Buddhist circuits in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh are already nearing completion”. The government is also taking a ‘Whole of Government’ approach to preserve Indian culture and heritage. Several central ministries like the Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Civil Aviation, Ministry of Tribal Affairs, initiatives like Namami Gange and Swachh Bharat etc all are converging together for holistic outcomes with respect to protecting Indian heritage. ****\\nNB/SK\\n\"),\n",

The ARTSC will allow reduction of on aircraft training, thereby ensuring higher availability of aircraft for operational missions. This facility will aid the aircrew in practising all operational missions and complex military scenarios and it will provide the men and women in the Indian Navy, the requisite training required to operate one of the most advanced aircraft – the P8I. The training simulator complex is named ‘Ashok Roy Training Simulator Complex’ to commemorate the distinguished service and the supreme sacrifice made by Late Lt Cdr Ashok Roy, VrC, NM during the gallant action in 1971 Indo Pak war. The state-of-the-art Boeing P8I aircraft inducted in the Indian Navy in 2013 have flown over 40,000hrs. Designed for Long Range Maritime Reconnaissance (LRMR), Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Anti Surface Warfare (ASuW) and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions, the aircraft plays a crucial role as eyes of the Indian Navy, in the vast expanse of IOR, whilst undertaking critical maritime operations. These aircraft thus, provide the nation requisite Maritime Domain Awareness, in our Area of Interest. To ensure that men and women operating these advanced aircraft are adequately trained to undertake various operational missions, Indian Navy signed a turnkey project with M/s Boeing in 2018 to build a simulator complex with on-site AMC of 10 years. The project, only the fourth of its kind in the world along with US, UK and Australia, is the first in Asia. The complex houses a state-of-the-art simulator for training requirements of P8I aircrew and technical team aimed towards safe operation and maintenance of the aircraft. The facility will significantly contribute towards improving training standards and reduction of training requirement on actual aircraft, thereby ensuring higher availability of aircraft for operational missions. The aircrew can practice emergencies such as Engine Failure/ Fire, Rapid Decompression, Reject Take Off since these can be easily simulated for honing flying skills, but cannot be practiced in actual flying missions. The simulator also provides a first-hand experience to the technical team to practice routine and special maintenance procedures with 3D software solutions, including armament loading/ unloading, as the facility is equipped with a to-scale model of aircraft wing and mock ups of missile and torpedo. The introduction of such a simulator is a transformative and progressive step towards quality training, which will significantly aid in enhancing the crew expertise towards ‘on-task’ mission effectiveness. The airfield at Arakkonam was constructed for use by the Allies during World\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 War II in early 1942. First reported air operations from the field took place when No. 2 Squadron of the Royal Indian Air Force, flying Westland Lysander aircraft undertook support flights for the British Indian Army between May - Sep 1942. During this period, 7 Rajput regiment was also stationed here, equipped with a Battery of 3.7 inch heavy Anti Air guns providing protection to the airfield. The airfield abandoned after war, lay unused until 1980s, when Indian Navy rehabilitated and commissioned the airfield as INS Rajali on 11 March 1992, by Hon’ble President of India R Venkataraman. The location and length of over 4000 m of runway optimally suited Indian Navy’s maritime surveillance and reconnaissance requirements. The air base has since become one of the largest and most advanced air stations in the country. The upgraded airbase is now home to a long-range maritime reconnaissance and anti-submarine warfare squadron, INAS 312 and Helicopter Training School, INAS 561, apart from operating HALE RPAs. The training simulator complex is named ‘Ashok Roy Training Simulator Complex’ (ARTSC) to honour the dedication to Service and the supreme sacrifice made by Late Lt Cdr Ashok Roy, Vir Chakra (VrC), Nausena Medal (NM) during the gallant action in the 1971 Indo Pak war. The officer was in command of a detachment of two anti-submarine and reconnaissance aircraft of the Indian Navy during the war. On 10 December 1971, an enemy surface force was reported at sea attempting to attack an Indian harbour. It was essential to locate the enemy force before an attack on own shores. An Alize aircraft under the command of Lt Cdr Ashok Roy was launched to search the enemy force. During this operation, Lt Cdr Ashok Roy’s aircraft was spotted by an enemy jet. Despite having a chance to retreat, he decided to continue his search for enemy force. In the ensuing battle between the two aircraft, the Alize was lost at sea. He was awarded ‘Vir Chakra’ posthumously for his service to the nation during the 1971 war. The inauguration of the ARTSC on 25 April 23 by Shri Giridhar Aramane, Defence Secretary, was also attended by the Managing Director, Boeing Defence India RAdm Surendra Ahuja (Retd) and the family members of Late Lt Cdr Ashok Roy, VrC, NM. ***********\\nVM/JSN\\n'),\n",

The Raksha Mantri stressed that the use of technology will increase across all sectors in the coming times and there is a need to achieve excellence in Science & Technology. He called upon the young ignited minds to ideate, innovate, research and make headways in the field to take the county to greater heights. Shri Rajnath Singh was of the view that the youth possess a unique power to create, nurture & transform and the Government is providing a level-playing field to them to ensure that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s vision of ‘New India’ is soon realised. He listed out a number of steps taken to tap the potential of the young minds, including the National Education Policy 2020, which focuses on holistic education and lays equal emphasis on knowledge and skills. He also spoke on campaigns such as Ayushman Bharat, Fit India movement, which aim to create a healthy, educated and skilled work-force. The Raksha Mantri highlighted the steps taken by Ministry of Defence for the youth to contribute to national security. He elaborated on the Innovations for Defence Excellence (iDEX) initiative, wherein the Armed Forces, Defence Public Sector Undertakings, Indian Coast Guard and Paramilitary forces seek solutions to their problem statements from the general public. “There are two ways to resolve a problem statement. One is to issue a tender and get it resolved through a foreign company. The other is to put forth the problem statement before the young ignited minds, which is 65% of the country’s population. This is the vision behind iDEX. In just five years since its launch, we have received an encouraging response. We have already launched nine Defence India Start-up Challenges. Youths have provided solutions to many problem statements. We not only adopt the ideas of the youth, but take it forward by connecting them with investors and providing grants,” Shri Rajnath Singh said. The Raksha Mantri also enumerated the initiatives taken to promote entrepreneurial mindset among the youth. He stated that a culture of venture capital funding has been developed for start-ups, which is important for their hand-holding at an early stage. “The number of unicorns in the country has crossed 100 from just four or five eight-nine years.

These values \\u200b\\u200bwill make the surging ahead India complete, he said. Shri Rajnath Singh also underscored the importance of a strong will to achieve any given task, stressing that both successes and failures are part of life and one should not get swayed away by the ups and downs. Referring to the news reports of suicides by IIT & NEET aspirants in Kota, he called upon the students to remember that no goal or dream is bigger than life. He termed it as the collective failure of society if any child takes such a drastic step. He urged all parents, relatives, teachers and friends to never judge children on the basis of their exam results, but assess them on their hard work. The Raksha Mantri lauded the Vidyapeeth for contributing in the all-round progress of the nation by implementing various plans in the fields of education, literature, culture and history, besides adopting latest technologies in line with the changing times.

Addressing the Defence Ministers of SCO member countries in New Delhi on April 28, 2023, Shri Rajnath Singh asserted that any kind of terrorist act or support to it in any form is a major crime against humanity and peace & prosperity cannot coexist with this menace. “If a nation shelters terrorists, it not only poses a threat to others, but for itself too. Radicalisation of youth is a cause of concern not only from the point of view of security, but it is also a major obstacle in the path of socio-economic progress of society. If we want to make the SCO a stronger & more credible international organisation, our top-most priority should be to effectively deal with terrorism,” the Raksha Mantri said. Shri Rajnath Singh added that India envisions a robust framework of regional cooperation which mutually respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all member states by taking care of their legitimate interests. He asserted that New Delhi strives to further bolster trust and cooperation among the members of the SCO as it believes in maintaining peace and security based on the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations. Sharing his insights on the vision to ensure collective prosperity, the Raksha Mantri called for concerted efforts by the SCO member states, so that the region, with limitless possibilities in today’s multilateral world, shifts to the mindset of\\xa0‘great gain from win-win paradigm’\\xa0from\\xa0‘great game of zero sum, win-lose paradigm’. “India has always followed the principle of\\xa0‘Let us walk together & move forward together’. Every era has a zeitgeist (defining idea). The zeitgeist of the present era is ‘Win-win cooperation for the great gain’,” he said. Shri Rajnath Singh also elaborated on the concept of ‘SECURE’ floated by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi during the SCO summit in Qingdao, China in 2018. He stated that every alphabet of the word ‘SECURE’ reflects India’s commitment towards the multi-dimensional welfare of the region. S\\xa0-\\xa0Security of citizens\\nE\\xa0-\\xa0Economic development for all\\nC\\xa0-\\xa0Connecting the region\\nU\\xa0-\\xa0Uniting the people\\nR\\xa0-\\xa0Respect for Sovereignty and Integrity\\nE\\xa0-\\xa0Environmental protection)\\n\\nDrawing the attention of the member states to various dimensions of ‘SECURE’, the Raksha Mantri stated that today a large part of the world is passing through a food crisis. He urged the SCO member countries to ensure food security under an integrated plan. This will establish SCO as a role model for the whole world, he said. To deal with the issue of climate change, he called for working on a common strategy, giving priority to mitigation and adaptation. Energy security should be a part of the common strategy, he added. Shri Rajnath Singh also touched upon the two defence-related activities launched by India, as the SCO chair, to increase interoperability among member states. These are: a workshop on ‘Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR)’ and a seminar on ‘defence think-tanks of SCO countries’. Both the events witnessed enthusiastic participation from all SCO countries. The Raksha Mantri voiced India’s commitment towards defence capacity building of SCO member states through training and co-manufacturing & co-development of items. He stated that as security challenges are not limited to any one country, India is moving forward with a collaborative approach in the field of defence partnership, keeping in mind the shared interests. Shri Rajnath Singh reiterated India’s commitment to play the role of a first responder and preferred partner for any HADR operation in the region. “Be it the\\xa0COVID-19\\xa0pandemic or the recent earthquake in Turkiye, India has always moved forward in line with its spirit of\\xa0‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’\\xa0(Whole world is one family),” he said. Earlier, in his opening remarks, the Raksha Mantri described the SCO as an evolved & strong regional organisation, underlining that India views it as an important entity to promote defence cooperation among member states. He urged the member states to take forward the age-old cultural and civilisational linkages among the nations in line with changing times, emphasising that the ties have enriched the countries economically and culturally for centuries. He called for a secure, stable and prosperous region that helps in improving the quality of life of the people of each member nation. At the end of the deliberations, all the SCO member countries signed a protocol, expressing their collective will to make the region secure, peaceful and prosperous. In his closing remarks, Shri Rajnath Singh called for joint efforts to ensure prosperity in the region while dealing with contemporary challenges. He stressed on the need to constantly make the SCO stronger and a more vibrant & resilient organisation in line with changing times. “It is our moral responsibility to start a new journey of development in the region through mutual cooperation, harmony and respect,” he said. Addressing mediapersons after the meeting, Defence Secretary Shri Giridhar Aramane stated that all the member nations arrived at the consensus on several areas of cooperation, including dealing with terrorism, security of vulnerable populations in various countries as well as HADR. He stated that all member states were unanimous in their statements that terrorism, in all its forms, must be condemned and eliminated. He exuded confidence that many areas identified for cooperation will be acted upon in the times to come and India, as the SCO chair, will lead from the front in ensuring a safe and secure future for the region and the world as a whole.

He expressed his happiness to be present in the Army Commander’s conference and complimented the Army leadership for successfully taking ahead the ‘Defence and Security’ vision of the Nation and the Hon’ble Prime Minister. The Hon’ble Raksha Mantri stressed upon the present complex world situation which effects everyone globally. He stated that “Unconventional and asymmetric warfare, including hybrid war will be part of the future conventional wars. Cyber, information, communication, trade and finance have all become an inseparable part of future conflicts. This necessitates that Armed Forces will have to keep all these facets in consideration while planning and formulating strategies”. Commenting on the current situation along the Northern borders, the Hon’ble Raksha Mantri expressed full confidence in the Army for any contingency though, the ongoing talks for peaceful resolution will continue and disengagement and de-escalation, is the best way forward. Expressing his gratitude, he remarked “It is our ‘Whole of Government’ approach to ensure availability of best weapons, equipment and clothing to our troops braving extreme weather and hostile forces to defend our territorial integrity”. The Raksha Mantri complimented the efforts of BRO, which has led to the incomparable improvement of road communication in the borders both Western and Northern, while working under difficult conditions. Referring to the situation along the Western borders, he complimented the Indian Army’s response to cross border terrorism, however the proxy war by the adversary continues. The Hon'ble Raksha Mantri said “I compliment the excellent synergy between the CAPF/ Police forces and the Army in tackling the menace of terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. The synergised operations in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir are contributing to increased stability and peace in the region and the same should continue, and for this I again compliment the Indian Army”. The Raksha Mantri commended the Army for the high standard of operational preparedness and capabilities which he has always been experiencing first hand during his visits to forward areas. He also paid tributes to all the brave hearts for making the ultimate sacrifice in the defence of the motherland. He complimented the significant contributions made by the Army in military diplomacy to further our national security interests by creating sustainable cooperative relationships with foreign Armies. He also applauded \\xa0Indian Army \\xa0for its effort in providing Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief Mission post earthquake in Turkey during ‘Operation Dost’. The Hon’ble Raksha Mantri stressed upon the technological advancement taking place in every sphere of our life and applauded the Armed Forces for aptly incorporating them. He appreciated the Army’s efforts to develop niche technologies in collaboration with civil industries, including premier educational institutions and thereby progressing towards the aim of ‘Modernisation through Indigenisation’ or ‘Atam Nirbharta’. He also stressed that as user we must \\xa0impose our faith in own Industries and technologies\\xa0 which would inturn motivate\\xa0 the Industry to produce the\\xa0 best as also would boost ‘Atam Nirbharta’. The Raksha Mantri also complemented the Army for its dedicated efforts towards the national vision of ‘Women Empowerment’ by grant of Permanent Commission and induction of women officers in most of the streams of Indian Army. He also complemented the Army in the execution of newly formulated recruitment scheme ‘Agniveers’ in the army as also the exuberance displayed by the youth of the county for the same. The Hon’ble Raksha Mantri released the second edition of Indian Army UN Journal titled ‘Blue Helmet Odessey- Changing Contours of Peacekeeping Operations in the 20th Century” which is a compilation of inputs from missions and perspectives by senior military leadership and diplomats and a commemorative postal stamp on the occasion of 75 years of Indian Army.

The KSB is the apex body of the Central Government and States/Union Territories (UTs) entrusted with the responsibility of the welfare and resettlement of the Ex-Servicemen (ESM). Ways to reach out to the ESM fraternity through policy measures to further ensure their welfare and resettlement were discussed during the meeting. Delivering the keynote address, Shri Rajnath Singh termed the ex-servicemen as national assets and urged States/UTs to devise new ways to utilise their rich and practical experience for the benefit of the nation. He stated that there is reservation in jobs for ex-servicemen in several states, which needs to be completely followed and monitored. The Raksha Mantri appreciated the fact that the Centre and States/UTs have always worked together for the welfare of soldiers, describing the works being carried out by KSB as a shining example of cooperative federalism. “There are differences between states or political parties on many issues. All this is part of a democracy. But, when it comes to the welfare of our soldiers & veterans, everyone comes on the same page. There is always social and political consensus for our soldiers. Just as the Armed Forces protect the whole nation equally, it is our national and collective responsibility to ensure that our soldiers lead a dignified life when they retire & return back to society,” he said. With a view to keeping the Armed Forces young, a large number of soldiers are honorably discharged at the age of 35-40 years. This results in the addition of about 60,000 soldiers every year to the existing strength of 34 lakh ex-servicemen. Shri Rajnath Singh voiced the Government’s unwavering resolve towards the welfare of the ESM fraternity, listing out a number of measures taken by the Ministry of Defence to ensure their well-being and development. “In the last three years, financial assistance of about Rs 800 crore has been provided to around 3.16 lakh beneficiaries under various welfare schemes of KSB. About Rs 240 crore were distributed to one lakh beneficiaries in the last financial year. The budget as required is being provided by the Government,” he said. The Raksha Mantri added that institutional grants have been given to Paraplegic Rehabilitation Centre, Kirkee; Cheshire Home, Mohali and 36 war memorial hospitals across the country including in Dehradun, Lucknow and Delhi. He reiterated that the health care of the ESM fraternity is the Government’s topmost priority and the Ex-Servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS) facilities are being reviewed on a regular basis. At present, 30 Regional Centres and 427 Polyclinic are functional. Approval for 75 Type C & D polyclinics are already given and video platform SeHAT OPD was launched to increase the reach. Empanelment of new quality hospitals like Tata Memorial Hospitals at various places are being done. Ease in procurement of medicines is being made to ensure availability of medicines for the beneficiaries. Shri Rajnath Singh also highlighted the special awareness and outreach programmes being conducted to reach out to the ESM fraternity. Special events are also being organised to include citizens and the corporate sector in the collective effort for the welfare and resettlement of the veterans. In all the schemes, the process from application to distribution is fully automated, he said. The Raksha Mantri commended the Armed Forces for ensuring border security and serving the nation whenever the need arises, especially during natural calamities. He lauded the ex-servicemen for keeping that fire of serving the motherland lit even after formally retiring from the service. He highlighted the valuable contribution made by the veterans on a number of occasions, especially during the country’s fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The ex-servicemen had assisted in the Government’s efforts by providing medicines, ventilators, oxygen cylinders and other relief material to the needy in different parts of the country. The agenda points of the meeting included ways to expand the scope of Armed Forces Veterans’ Day celebrations; enhancing pride amongst ESM community; increase in grants under Armed Forces Flag Day Fund; Uniformity in State benefits/grants provided to Armed Forces personnel; establishment of ESM Corporation in respective states and instituting an award for the best performing Rajya Sainik Board. Shri Rajnath Singh hoped that the System for Pension Administration Raksha (SPARSH) will go a long way in solving the pension issues faced by the ex-servicemen. He urged the state governments to give priority to resolving land dispute issues of ex-servicemen as well as serving personnel. Ministers of various States; Chief of the Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan; Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral R Hari Kumar; Chief of the Army Staff General Manoj Pande; Secretary (Ex-servicemen Welfare) Shri Vijoy Kumar Singh; Secretary, KSB Commodore HP Singh; representatives from States/UTs and other senior civil & military officers took part in the deliberations. *****\\nABB/Savvy/GC\\n'),\n",

Virtually addressing the National Academy of Medical Sciences (NAMS) on its 63rd Foundation Day in New Delhi on April 21, 2023, he said the country’s strong and youthful human resources must be nurtured properly to leverage their strength in making country stronger and self-reliant. He complemented the NAMS for its contribution to the growth of Indian health sector, Medical education and research, as well as formulation of relevant health policies and establishment of 6 AIIMS all over the country. Highlighting health as a key element in the development of any nation, Shri Rajnath Singh said overall development of the country is possible only if its citizens are healthy. The healthier people will be able to work for the progress of the country in a better manner and that is why health sector is key for our country. It is for this reason doctors and medical practitioners are respected and revered. Quoting Swami Vivekanand he said “ Guru should be like doctor who could understand his disciple and his nature and could impart knowledge to disciple which is most appropriate for him” he said that Guru has been given supreme position in our culture as it is through Guru one can have glimpse of\\xa0 God. Listing out the steps taken by government in ensuring health for all, Shri Rajnath Singh called on the medical fraternity to focus more on research of public health related issues. “During Covid we all realized how important research is in the health sector. The benefits of any research done in the health sector are not only quick, but with that research we can help our country as well as many countries of the world. Even during Covid, we saw how the vaccines made by Indian scientists and researchers benefited not only us but the whole world’, he added. Shri Rajnath Singh elaborated on the importance of the broader aspects of health which goes beyond having no illness and is linked with the vision of 'Healthy India, Strong India’. He added “According to World Health Organisation (WHO), good health encompasses complete physical, mental and social well-being of a person. That is, health does not just mean that you do not have any disease, health is a much wider concept than this. It includes healthy life style, physical fitness, mental health, and social well-being.”\\nRaksha Mantri highlighted the significance of social well-being which he viewed as the third dimension of health besides physical and mental health. He expressed concern that the social well-being is facing challenges as people move from their native places to urban centers and other places in search of work. Cut off from their roots, they feel lonely and insecure which impacts their health adversely. In addition, nuclear family and sub nuclear family have become more prominent with even single parenting emerging on the scene. Shri Rajnath Singh added that such developments, if left unchecked, may endanger the institution of marriage and single person households may become common. “It may appear to be a matter of freedom of choice, but in reality it is a big social crisis pushing human beings towards loneliness which need to be avoided. Many medical studies indicate that loneliness is the root cause of physical, mental and psychological problems of a person. We need to introspect whether we are destroying our social well-being in the name of so called modernity,” he said. Shri Rajnath Singh was of view that spiritual health is the fourth dimension of health besides physical, mental and social well-being. Elaborating upon the spiritual health which is based on having empathy with fellow human beings, he added “Today, it is very necessary for a human being to be spiritually healthy. Here when I am talking about spirituality, I do not mean any kind of religious rituals. By spirituality, I mean that state of human mind, when it starts experiencing oneness with whole creation and connects itself with the whole world. That is, when a man starts considering the happiness and sorrow of the society as his own, then that man becomes spiritual, in my view”, he added. ****\\nABB/GC\\n\"),\n",

Inaugurating the three-day International Conference on Defence Finance & Economics in New Delhi on April 12, 2023, Shri Rajnath Singh asserted that a legal and procedural defence-finance framework is an integral part of a mature state system, which ensures prudent management of the defence expenditure. The Raksha Mantri stated that such a framework, which includes expenditure control as per guidelines, financial advice by professionals, audit, payment authentication mechanism, etc., ensures that the defence spending is well within the allocated budget and the full value of money is realised. He emphasised that while the Armed Forces require a superstructure of defence ecosystem, involving R&D organisations, industries, soldier welfare organisations, etc., they also need a well-funded system with a robust architecture to ensure the optimum and judicious use of financial resources. Shri Rajnath Singh was of the view that it is difficult to apply the economic concept of full value of money in defence expenditure, as in this sector, there is no visible revenue stream and no easily identifiable beneficiaries. To maximise the value of money spent, he stressed that the rule of competitive bidding through open tender must be followed in defence procurement. “In the case of procurement of defence platforms/equipment, either under capital or revenue route, the gold standard of Open Tender should be adopted to the extent possible. A competitive bid based procurement process, which is open to all, is the best possible way to realise the full value of the public money being spent. There would be some rare cases when it may not be possible to go for an open tender process. Such instances should come under exceptions and exceptions should not become the rule,” the Raksha Mantri said. Shri Rajnath Singh underscored the importance of comprehensive Blue Books, codifying the rules and procedures of procurement of defence equipment & systems for a fair and transparent system. He said, with this vision, the Government has formulated Blue books in the form of Defence Acquisition Procedure 2020 for capital acquisition; Defence Procurement Manual for revenue procurement and Delegation of Financial Powers to Defence Services. “These manuals play a very important role in ensuring that the process of defence procurement is rule-bound and follows the principles of financial propriety. Since these manuals are critical, they need to be carefully crafted by defence finance and procurement experts in consultation with all the stakeholders. This needs to be a continuous exercise, so that these documents are dynamically updated, incorporating new rules and procedures as and when required,” he said. The Raksha Mantri also emphasised on the role of expert financial advice to the Service personnel in day-to-day financial matters. He said, the system of Integrated Financial Advisor (IFA) has been created to provide financial advice to the Competent Financial Authority (CFA) in order to help them in avoiding the wastage of public money. In this system, the IFA and CFA work as a team towards utilising public money in a prudent manner, he said. Shri Rajnath Singh batted for a fool-proof system of internal and external audit which would tackle the instances of wastages, pilferage and corruption, if any, even after following the principles of financial prudence and propriety. The role of auditors is that of a watchdog or a sentinel, he said. The Raksha Mantri also elaborated on the need for a sound system of accounting, passing of bills and payment, salary and pension disbursal, etc., as it frees the Armed Forces personnel to concentrate on their core jobs. He added that the separation of functions of defence finance from the core defence organisations has multiple advantages. “The chances of leakages, corruption, wastages are reduced. A positive public opinion is generated when there is a justified confidence that public money is being spent optimally and prudently. With greater public trust and confidence in the system of defence expenditure, the defence system benefits overall, as the chances of greater funding by legislature increases pari-passu (Latin for equal footing),” he said. Shri Rajnath Singh asserted that the central idea is that defence establishments like Army, Navy, Air Force, Defence Research organisations etc. require a specialised agency, which is dedicated to defence finance and economics. In India, this work is being done competently by the Defence Accounts Department under the leadership of Financial Advisor (Defence Services), he said. Before the international delegates, the Raksha Mantri also put forth the idea of shared security. “In the spirit of collective security of the whole world as one family, we are all partners in the path towards a secure and prosperous future for the entire humankind. We have a lot to learn from your experiences in the field of defence finance and economics and we are ready to share our learning with you,” he said. The Raksha Mantri stated that the full potential of society’s development can be realised only when it is secure from external and internal threats. He described security of the people from external aggression and internal disruptions as the prime function of the state. Security is the bedrock on which the prosperity, arts and culture of any society flourish and prosper, he said.

Temperature regulates insects’ physiology and metabolism. An increase in temperature increases physiological activity and, therefore, metabolic rates. Insects must eat more to survive and it’s expected that insect herbivores will consume more and grow faster. This will lead to increases in the population growth rate of certain insects. Because they grow fast they’ll reproduce more. Their numbers will multiply and this will ultimately lead to more crop damage. Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) doesn’t have any centralized data on the details of diseases expected to be spread as a result of increase in population of insects. However, India Meteorological Department (IMD) issues agro meteorological advisories through Gramin Krishi Mausam Sewa (GKMS) scheme for the benefit of farming community in the country. Presently agromet advisories are being prepared on every Tuesday and Friday for all the agriculturally important districts (~700) and around 3100 blocks by 130 Agromet Field Units (AMFUs) and 199 District Agromet Units (DAMUs). These advisories also include the information regarding pests and diseases which affect agriculture. Also Pest-Weather calendars are prepared for every crop which could be used as reference tools. There has been a continuous global effort to control/arrest the global warming trends through various means. IMD under this ministry, issues forecast and warnings related to severe weather events including heat waves, in different spatial and temporal scales and share the same with public as well as disaster management authorities so as to initiate required mitigation measures. As an initiative IMD is issuing Seasonal Outlook for temperatures for the months of April, May & June in the last week of March for planning purpose. This outlook brings out the expected scenario of heat waves also during the period. The seasonal outlook is followed by Extended Range Outlook issued on every Thursday for next two weeks. In addition to this, the forecast and the colour coded warnings for severe weather including heat wave warning are issued on daily basis for next five days with outlook for another two days. As an adaptive measure, India Meteorological Department (IMD) in collaboration with local health departments have started heat action plan in many parts of the country since 2013 to forewarn people about the heat waves and also advising action to be taken during such occasions. Heat Action Plan, implemented in 23 States in collaboration with National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), is a comprehensive early warning system and preparedness plan for extreme heat events.

A low probability for occurrence of heatwave over Central India is likely during March 2023. The rainfall in March 2023 averaged over the country is most likely to be normal (83- 117% of LPA). Below normal rainfall is most likely over most areas of northwest India, west central India and some parts of east & northeast India. Normal to above normal rainfall is likely over most parts of peninsular India, east central India and some isolated pockets of northeast India. To minimize the effect of abnormally high temperature including heatwave during the summer session for the period from 1 April to 30 June, IMD issues colour coded impact based heatwave warning for the benefit of the Public and users. IMD has finalized the impacts and suggested actions with respect to the intensity of heatwave and the colour code used for related warning, in collaboration with National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). As a mitigation measure, IMD in collaboration with local health departments have started heat action plan in many parts of the country to forewarn about the heat waves and also advising action to be taken during such occasions. The Heat Action Plan is a comprehensive early warning system and preparedness plan for extreme heat events. The plan presents immediate as well as longer-term actions to increase preparedness, information-sharing, and response coordination to reduce the health impacts of extreme heat on vulnerable populations. NDMA and IMD are working with 23 states prone to high temperatures leading to heat-wave conditions for supporting heat action plans. Heat Wave Warnings are disseminated through the following modes:\\nThis information was given by the Minister for State (Independent Charge) for Ministry of Science and Technology and Earth Sciences, Dr. Jitendra Singh in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.'),\n",

Ravichandran told the media today that the country as a whole is likely to receive 96% of the south west monsoon from June to September and farmers need not worry about deficient rainfall. Briefing the media about the summary of the 2023 Southwest Monsoon Season Rainfall, he said there will be 96% of the Long Period Average (LPA) with a model error of ± 5% (Normal). He added the Long Period Average (LPA) with a model error of ± 5% (Normal). Dr. Ravichandran said, the forecast\\xa0is based on both dynamical and statistical models, and it suggests that quantitatively, the monsoon seasonal rainfall is likely to be 96% of the Long Period Average (LPA) with a model error of ± 5%. The LPA of the seasonal rainfall over the country as a whole based on data of 1971-2020 is 87 cm.

The northern hemisphere snow cover areas during February and March 2023 were observed to be below normal. Winter and spring snow cover extent over Northern Hemisphere as well as Eurasia has a tendency of general inverse relationship with the subsequent summer monsoon rainfall. Since 2003, India Meteorological Department (IMD) has been issuing the operational long-range forecast (LRF) for the southwest monsoon seasonal (June to September) rainfall averaged over the country as a whole in two stages. The first stage forecast is issued in April and the second stage or update forecast is issued by the end of May. Since 2021, IMD has implemented a new strategy for issuing monthly and seasonal operational forecasts for the southwest monsoon rainfall over the country by modifying the existing two stage forecasting strategy. The new strategy uses both dynamical and statistical forecasting system. Multi-Model Ensemble (MME) forecasting system based on coupled global climate models (CGCMs) from different global climate prediction centers, including IMD’s Monsoon Mission Climate Forecast System (MMCFS) is used in dynamical forecast system. Giving a detailed presentation DG,IMD, Dr Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said that Currently, La Nina conditions changed to Neutral conditions over the equatorial Pacific region. The latest MMCFS as well as other climate model forecast indicates that El Niño conditions are likely to develop during the monsoon season. The northern hemisphere snow cover areas during February and March 2023 were observed to be below normal. Winter and spring snow cover extent over Northern Hemisphere as well as Eurasia has a tendency of general inverse relationship with the subsequent summer monsoon rainfall. Dr. Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said IMD will issue the updated forecasts for monsoon season rainfall in the last week of May 2023. The spatial distribution of probabilistic forecasts for tercile categories (above normal, normal and below normal) for the seasonal rainfall (June to September) is shown in Fig.1. The spatial distribution suggests normal to above normal rainfall likely over many areas of Peninsular India and adjoining East Central India, Northeast India and over some parts of Northwest India. Normal to below normal rainfall is likely over some areas of Northwest India and parts of Western Central India and some pockets of Northeast India. White shaded areas within the land represent climatological probabilities. At present, neutral Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) conditions are present over the Indian Ocean and the latest Climate models forecast indicates that the positive IOD conditions are likely to develop during the southwest monsoon season. Dr. Mohapatra pointed out that as sea surface temperature (SST) conditions over the Pacific and the Indian Oceans are known to have a strong influence on the Indian monsoon, IMD is carefully monitoring the evolution of sea surface conditions over these Ocean basins.

Under the scheme, medium range weather forecast at district and block level for next five days is generated and based on the forecast, 130 Agromet Field Units (AMFUs) located at State Agricultural Universities (SAUs), institutes of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) etc. and District Agromet Units (DAMUs) at Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) under ICAR network prepare Agromet Advisories on every Tuesday and Friday for the districts under their jurisdiction and for the blocks of the district of their location and communicate to the farmers to take decision on day-to-day agricultural operations. Presently agromet advisories are being prepared on every Tuesday and Friday for all the agriculturally important districts (~700) and around 3100 blocks by 130 AMFUs and 199 DAMUs. Weather plays a crucial role in agriculture and changes in weather patterns can have a significant impact on crop yields. Weather-based crop advisory services can provide real-time information about weather patterns, crop health and appropriate measures to the farmers enabling them to make informed decisions about various crop management practices leading to higher yields and increased income. In order to cater the need of the farming community, District level AAS was initiated in collaboration with ICAR and SAUs through the network of 130 AMFUs located across the country with an aim of providing more relevant weather information and location and crop specific advisories. After successful implementation of district level AAS, with the introduction of upgraded high-resolution models, the service has further extended to the block level with the establishment of DAMUs in the premises of KVKs of ICAR. AAS rendered by IMD is a step towards weather-based crop and livestock management strategies and operations dedicated to enhancing crop production and food security besides reducing crop damage and loss due to unusual weather. Along with the biweekly bulletins, daily weather forecast and nowcast information are also disseminated to the farmers by Regional Meteorological Centres (RMCs) and Meteorological Centres (MCs) of IMD. Impact based forecast (IBFs) for agriculture are also being prepared by AMFUs and DAMUs based on the severe weather warnings for different districts of various States and UTs across the country issued by National Weather Forecasting Centre (NWFC), New Delhi and RMCs and MCs of IMD. Agromet Advisories are disseminated to the farmers through multichannel dissemination system like print and electronic media, Door Darshan, radio, internet etc. including SMS using mobile phones through Kisan Portal and also through private companies under Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode. Farmers access the weather information including alerts and related agromet advisories specific to their districts through the mobile App viz., ‘Meghdoot’ launched by Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India. These weather details are also accessible by farmers through another App ‘Kisan Suvidha’, launched by Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare. Social media like ‘WhatsApp’ is also used for quicker dissemination of weather forecast and agromet advisories. WhatsApp groups of farmers have been created by various AMFUs and DAMUs to disseminate agromet services. State Agriculture Department officials of District and Block level are also included in these WhatsApp groups. IMD is also taking continuous efforts to popularize the services among the farming community by organising Farmers’ Awareness Programmes (FAPs) in collaboration with AMFUs and DAMUs in various parts of the country. IMD along with the experts from AMFUs and DAMUs also participate in Kisan Melas, Farmers’ Day etc. to create awareness about the services, so that more farmers get benefitted. To assess the economic impact of weather forecast-based advisories, multiple studies were conducted by an independent third-party organization viz., National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) in 2009, 2015 and also recently in 2020. The recent study of 2020 concluded that 98% of surveyed farmers (3,965 farmers across 121 districts of 11 states of India) made modifications to at least one of nine practices based on weather advisories. Average annual income of farming households increased from 1.98 Lakh, which adopted no modifications to Rs 3.02 Lakh which adopted all the 9 practices. An additional annual income was estimated of Rs. 12,500 per agricultural household belonging to Below Poverty Line category in rain-fed areas, while total income gain was estimated at Rs. 13,331 crore per annum in rain-fed districts. An investment of Rs 1000 crores will yield economic benefits of about Rs 50000 crores over a reiod of 5 years.

School Education works as the foundation stone of a child’s life. In the context of school education, NEP 2020 recommends shift from 10+2 structure to 5+3+3+4 and emphasises on developmental perspectives suggesting curricular and pedagogical shifts at different stages- foundational, preparatory, middle and secondary. NEP 2020 focusses on competency-based education integrating cultural rootedness, equity and inclusion, multilingualism, experiential learning, reduction in content load, integration of arts and sports in the curriculum, etc. As a follow-up of the NEP 2020, development of four National Curriculum Frameworks, viz., NCF for School Education, NCF for Early Childhood Care and Education, NCF for Teacher Education and NCF for Adult Education has been initiated. National Steering Committee under the Chairpersonship of Dr. K. Kasturirangan was set up by the Ministry of Education to undertake and guide the development of NCFs. Going through a participatory process of deliberations, inputs were sought for the National Curriculum Frameworks (in the area of ECCE, School Education, Teacher Education and Adult Education) from diverse stakeholders including teachers, parents, students, educational institutions, neo- and non- literates, subject experts, scholars, childcare personnel etc. Extensive public consultations in face-to-face as well as digital mode were carried out. In this process of deliberations and discussions, more than 500 District Level Consultations and more than 50 consultations with different Ministries, religious groups, civil society organisations, NGOs and Universities were held in face-to-face mode with the participation of more than 8000 diverse stakeholders. In digital mode, Mobile App survey has received feedback from around 1,50,000 stakeholders. The Citizen Centric Survey, launched by the Ministry of Education in August 2022, has received inputs from more than 12,00,000 stakeholders. Inputs are being received in all areas of ECCE, School Education, Teacher Education and Adult Education. The highlights of the inputs revealed endorsement of the recommendations of NEP 2020 from all the regions. Taking into cognizance these inputs, the National Curriculum Framework for Foundational Stage had been brought out and launched by the Ministry of Education on 20th October 2022. In continuation of this NCF-FS, National Curriculum Framework for School Education – Pre-Draft is also ready. Given the diverse needs of students, multiple pedagogic approaches, learning-teaching material at the different stages of school education, it is felt important to take feedback from students, parents, teachers, teacher educators, experts, scholars and professionals on the various sections and recommendations of this NCF-School Education (SE). While giving your feedback, it needs to be kept in view that this is a pre-draft of the NCF-SE which is still requires several rounds of discussion within the National Steering Committee. Feedback from diverse stakeholders will further help NSC to look critically into different modalities and approaches that this framework is proposing. Feedback is solicited specifying the stage of school education, curricular area, school governance, assessment, etc. You may send your feedback on the following email addresses- ncf.ncert@ciet.nic.in\\nLink to the document- https://ncf.ncert.gov.in/webadmin/assets/b27f04eb-65af-467f-af12-105275251546\\n******\\nNB/AK\\n'),\n",

Shri Pradhan highlighted NEP 2020 envisioned under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has placed equal importance on education and skilling. It has paved the way for integration of schooling and skilling, horizontal & vertical mobility through National Credit Framework and redefining India’s skills ecosystem. Shri Pradhan stressed that the joint workshop between India Singapore will focus on leveraging the expertise & knowledge of Singapore and facilitate mutual sharing of experiences for addressing obstacles to skilling and further transforming the Indian skills ecosystem. He expressed his happiness that in the context of Future of Work, India and Singapore are engaging holistically to deliberate upon three major aspects:\\n1) Development of new curriculum for skill\\n2)Framework for skilling ecosystem in higher education\\n3) Compulsory apprenticeship and frameworks for lifelong skilling.

He pointed out that Singapore is the first country to establish linkages with UPI through their fast payment system PayNow. Also, few days ago Indian rocket PSLV placed two Singapore satellites into the orbit. He said that there is a huge opportunity to extend this cooperation to the space of skilling. He pointed out Singapore follows a skilling philosophy of leaving no one behind, training for decent jobs and building a confident nation because decent job increases the confidence of the individuals and their families. The objective of this workshop was threefold. (a) to catalyze exchange of knowledge between India and Singapore, two countries with a rich history of progressive reform in the sphere of education and skilling. The discussions in today’s workshop facilitated learning around best practices and policy responses that enable the development of robust education and skilling ecosystems. (b) The discussions, in turn, also uncovered pathways for collaboration, and c) Finally, workshop served a very important role in breaking what is known as the competency trap. Over time, we get better and better at what we do but that tends to constrain our thinking in certain directions. Therefore, when we need to innovate for a new world, the difficulty is not so much in developing new ideas as in escaping from old ones. In bringing together a very diverse set of stakeholders from two different countries under one roof, this workshop opened our perspectives and thinking on the way forward. In terms of content, there were three thematic discussions. For vocational education to be widely adopted, it must be respected. That, in turn, is enabled through creation of progression pathways not just in the labour market but also in mainstream school education. Therefore, the first session on integration of skills in the school education curriculum advanced the understanding of how progression pathways in education can be created for vocational education learners. Adoption also requires vocational education to be relevant. The second session, therefore, focused on an agile and resilient TVET ecosystem for creating a future-ready workforce. This discussion advanced the understanding of the different ways in which industry can inform and integrate with the TVET ecosystem to drive superior workforce outcomes for TVET graduates and render them future-ready. Finally, it is fair to say that we live in an incredibly dynamic world. Rapid technological advances like generative AI are transforming the world of work and necessitating a response from education systems. In a recent report for the World Bank, it was found the most substantive impact of AI is not loss of work as is thought\\xa0 but rather, reconfiguration of work so that humans and machines can work together to increase productivity. In such a fast-paced environment, the ability to learn is important but not as important as the ability to learn and unlearn. The third session, therefore, focused on lifelong learning and skill recognition in the context of future of work. *****\\nNB/AK\\n'),\n",

Mann ki Baat, started on 3rd October 2014 is a very popular programme of the Prime Minister of India which has completed 100 episodes in the last nine years where he has raised hundreds of varied issues for making the country better. All these issues are based on deep and sound researches, feedback from various stakeholders and practitioners from the length and breadth of the country. Through Mann ki Baat he brought the concerns, including various educational aspects before the country with facts and figures and received tremendous response from the public each time. It has impacted all sections of the society, who have been inspired to contribute towards fulfilling the great goals he has set before the nation. On 30th April, 2023\\xa0 the 100th episode of the Mann ki Baat\\xa0 took place and at this juncture, the glimpses of the numerous initiatives of the Ministry of Education (MoE), Government of India and it’s various autonomous institutions highlight the impact the programme has on Indian education system. MoE undertook several initiatives such as identifying young artistic talents through Kala Utsav, programmes for Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat, National Yoga Olympiad, encouraging Toy-based Pedagogy for schools to promote traditional Indian toys and games, Pariksha pe Charcha, NIPUN Bharat for early Literacy and Numeracy, National Digital Library for schools, NDEAR for digital education, Manodarpan and Sahyog, PM e-Vidya, SWAYAMPRABHA channels and many more. Academicians and professors of the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) too were inspired by many of the ideas that the Prime Minister brought to the notice of academia. It took several initiatives to give them a tangible form. In the sixty-sixth episode of Mann Ki Baat, the Prime Minister gave a call to promote its traditional games and toys, and expressed his concern about the toy industry’s quality and the children’s health issues caused by cheap toys (made of plastic) pouring the market from unorganized sources. In the previous episodes of June and July 2020, he had already talked about being Vocal for Local and discovering ways to be engaged at home during the national lockdown through traditional games. National Education Policy 2020 too emphasized upon the joyful learning. These were taken very seriously by the Ministry of Education and within two years, through toy based pedagogy the message to promote Indian toys has reached every household. Giving space to the traditional toys in the school system, the National Curriculum Framework for Foundational stage and the Draft National Curriculum Framework for School Education, the learning-teaching materials for Foundational stage, the Handbook of Toy based Pedagogy for all stages and subjects of school education, organizing International Webinar, national and regional seminars and webinar, toy hackathon, national toy fair for school education, including a separate category of Indigenous Toys and Games in Kala Utsav from 2020 where two hundred boys and girls participated, embedding training modules in NISHTHA for Foundational and Secondary stages where more than 21 Lakh teachers have taken the module of Toy based Pedagogy are some of the significant initiatives undertaken by the NCERT and other institutions in school education and as a result of his vision for incorporating traditional Indian games and toys into the classroom for school activities the idea has penetrated into the system. In many of his episodes of Mann ki Baat, the Prime Minister narrated the tradition of practicing yoga for mental, physical and spiritual health from ancient times, and declaring 21st June as International Yoga Day on that day in 2015 at the UN General Assembly, made the academia think of various ways to make it a part of practice for all students of the country.\"),\n",

Hundreds of students from in the age groups of 10-18 years (Class VI-XII) reach the National level starting from school, district and state level competitions. So far, more than sixteen hundred students have participated. Thus, a very large number of schools and students take part in the different levels of event. This is the impact which Mann ki Baat has upon the people. Mental Health and Well-Being of his people, specially children has always been a concern of the Prime Minister and he raised several issues through Mann ki Baat about the stress, pressure of examination, peer and parental pressure, all related to mental health of students. This has made several recommendations and initiatives by the Ministry including very effective programmes of Pariksha pe Charcha and Manodarpan. While Pariksha pe Charcha is an annual event where he address the students to overcome the examination stress, there are several activities under the Manodarpan since July 2020 to provide psychosocial support to students, teachers and families for mental health and emotional well-being during COVID-19 and beyond. There is a 24x7 helpline for students, parents and teachers to address the rising mental health concerns of students’ well-being and promote mental health in the school system as a whole.

Regular weekly online interactive sessions are organized and a mental health survey has been conducted to know find out the status of mental health of the students and teachers and the issues faced by them. There have been several nation-wide digital educational programmes, specially during the COVID-19 period by the Government of India through several national educational institutes such as NCERT, CBSE, UGC, IGNOU and NIOS, etc. Maximum use of technology contributed towards fulfilling quality and universal education through programmes like NISHTHA, e-pathshala, NROER, NIPUN Bharat Abhiyan, PM e-Vidya, SWAYAMPRABHA, DIKSHA etc. to support the uninterrupted education of crores of children. Analysis of the daily rising hits show the popularity of the programmes and their outreach. These have been very supportive and several studies have been conducted of its effectiveness by NCERT. A study was conducted by RIE, Mysuru where student-teachers were included who will become the future teachers and teacher educators, whose opinions therefore play a significant role in utilizing the digital resources. The study says that 77% of the student–teachers are aware of PM-Mann Ki Baat, and they find this program useful in teaching, training and subject content as well. The study also shows that percentage of the student-teachers’ awareness is 81% for e-pathshala, 78% for DIKSHA, 78% for SWAYAM, 52% for NISHTHA, 38% for NROER and only 36% for SWAYAM Prabha. NIPUN Bharat Mission has proved to be an effective teaching methodology after the New Education Policy 2020 and various initiatives have been taken up the NCERT under the guidance of Ministry of Education. Some of the initiatives taken up by the Ministry of Education and the NCERT have been studied by the faculty members, and a special issue of Indian Educational Review (IER), one of the prestigious journals of NCERT, April 2023 has been brought out highlighting the impact of ‘Mann Ki Baat’, having ten research papers, three in English, two each in Marathi, Gujarati and Kannada, and one is in Odia. *****\\nNB/AK\\n'),\n",

In this legal landscape, the online gaming industry in India has seen immense growth in the recent past. However, despite this existing legal landscape, various social and economic concerns have emerged from this industry over the past few years including:\\n(a)\\xa0\\xa0user harms in the nature of addiction-related concerns among children and adults, especially in terms of financial losses incurred by adult users due to such addiction;\\n(b)\\xa0\\xa0content-related concerns in terms of depiction of violent or inappropriate content, with absence of concrete measures to prevent children from accessing such content or real money games;\\n(c)\\xa0\\xa0ads of offshore gambling and betting websites targeting Indian users;\\n(d)\\xa0\\xa0lack of safeguards to secure users’ money and money laundering-related concerns in the absence of any strict KYC mechanism. To address such concerns effectively through legal means, the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) has introduced various checks and balances through relevant amendments to the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 notified on April 06, 2023. The purpose of these amendments is to control the unabated and unwarranted negative impact of online gaming activities on users, especially children and other vulnerable sections of society. The rules provide adequate controls to protect Indian Digital\\xa0Nagriks\\xa0from illegal gambling and betting websites and apps –\\nThe rules cast an obligation on intermediaries, including social media platforms and app stores, to make reasonable efforts to not host, publish or share any online game that causes user harm or which has not been verified as a permissible online game by an online gaming self-regulatory body (SRB) designated by the Central Government. The rules even disallow intermediaries to host or display any advertisement or surrogate advertisement or promotion of an online game that is not a permissible online game. This will help to address the growing menace of online ads of illegal betting and gambling operations targeting Indian users. The rules will ensure that online games or sites that involve wagering will be banned completely including advertising or any time of presence. For this, the\\xa0rules introduce the concept of ‘permissible online game’. These rules will ultimately allow only such online real money games in India that are verified by SRBs as- (a) not involving wagering on any outcome; (b) being compliant with the obligations under these rules; (c) the age under law at which an individual is competent to enter into a contract, and (d) the framework made by the SRB. Additionally, in case of any other non-real money online game that has the potential to cause user harm or affect the security of India, the Central Government has the power to require such online games to be subject to the obligations under the rules as are applicable to online real money games. Thus, this empowers the Government to control any non-real money online game that could have a harmful impact on the Digital\\xa0Nagriks. The rules address addiction-related concerns among children and adults through safeguards such as warning messages, monetary spending limit and time limit:\\nTo be verified as a permissible online real money game, an SRB will ensure that any online game is tested against the framework published by the SRB on its website. This framework will mandatorily include at least the following safeguards:\\na. measures to ensure that such online real money game is not against the interests of sovereignty and integrity of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States and public order;\\nb. safeguards against user harm including self-harm and psychological harm;\\nc. measures to safeguard children through parental controls and age-rating mechanism, and\\nd. measures to safeguard users against the risk of gaming addiction, financial loss and fraud through measures such as repeated warning messages at higher frequency in long gaming session and provision to enable a user to exclude himself upon user-defined limits being reached for time or money spent. Thus, the SRB’s framework will ensure that only such online games that have implemented the above safeguards are allowed to operate. This will also protect children and vulnerable sections of the society from the negative effects of online games. The rules will enhance public awareness about trusted online games that have been subject to a mandatory verification process:\\nUsers can identify permissible online games through a demonstrable and visible mark of verification to be displayed mandatorily for all online games verified by SRBs. The rules require SRBs to publish the following information on their website/mobile app:\\na. Updated list of all permissible online real money games verified by it, with the applicant details, dates and period of validity of verification, reasons of verification and the details of the suspension or revocation of verification. b. Updated list of present and former SRB members, date of acceptance as member, their corporate or business-related identity number, and the details of suspension or revocation of membership. The rules ensure transparency and full accountability of online gaming intermediaries enabling access to online real money games through mandatory KYC, discouraging providing credit financing options to users, conformity with requisite framework of SRB and other monetary protection measures:\\nOnline gaming intermediaries enabling access to online real money games will have to comply with the following requirements:\\na. Disclose relevant information to users through terms of service and privacy policy:\\ni. all the online games offered, with the policy for withdrawal or refund of the deposit made, how the winnings will be decided and distributed, and any other payable charges;\\nii. the\\xa0KYC procedure\\xa0followed before accepting any user deposit in cash or kind;\\niii. measures taken to\\xa0protect user deposits; and\\niv. the\\xa0framework of the SRB\\xa0of which the online gaming intermediary is a member\\nb. identify and\\xa0verify the user identity\\xa0before accepting any user deposit in cash or kind based on the identification procedure specified for entities regulated by the RBI\\nc. not giving credit or enabling financing\\xa0by third parties to the users\\n\\nThe rules also enable an aggrieved user to have an option to appeal before the Grievance Appellate Committee (GAC) against the decision of the Grievance Officer of the online gaming intermediary concerned in case the above specified disclosures under the rules are not conveyed to the users by such online gaming intermediary. Other obligations for such online gaming intermediaries include—\\na. Appoint a Chief Compliance Officer, nodal contact person and Resident Grievance Officer. This will ensure accountability of such intermediaries to the law, law enforcement agencies and to the users. b. Publish monthly compliance report on user complaints. c. Publish its physical contact address in India on its website or mobile app. This will enable the government to trace the illegal activities performed by such intermediaries, which was otherwise difficult to do in case of rogue foreign websites/apps. d.'),\n",

Through an amendment enacted in 2019 to the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016; entities were allowed to perform authentication if the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) is satisfied about their compliance with regard to standards of privacy and security specified by regulations and is either permitted by law to offer authentication services or seeks authentication for a prescribed purpose. At present, Government Ministries and Departments are allowed to undertake Aadhaar Authentication under the Aadhaar Authentication for Good Governance (Social Welfare, Innovation, Knowledge) Rules, 2020 in the interest of good governance, preventing leakage of public funds and enablement of innovation and the spread of knowledge. Now, it is proposed that any entity other than a Government Ministry or Department that desires to use Aadhaar authentication for the purpose of promoting ease of living and enabling better access to services, or usage of digital platforms to ensure good governance, or preventing dissipation of social welfare benefits, or enabling innovation and spread of knowledge, it shall prepare a proposal giving justification as to how the authentication sought is for one of the said purposes and in the interest of State and submit the same to the concerned Ministry or Department of the Central Government in respect of Central subjects and of the State Government in respect of State subjects. If the Ministry/Department is of the opinion that the proposal submitted fulfils such a purpose and is in the interest of the State, it will forward the proposal along with its recommendation to MeitY.

As per procedure, the proposals are first appraised by the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) at Central level or by the State Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC) at State/Union Territory level as the case may be. If recommended, the proposals are further considered by the Ministry or State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA), respectively, for grant of EC. In case of Maharashtra, three SEACs have been constituted on request of the State Government so as to avoid pendency of EC. One of these three SEACs is dedicated exclusively for the building and construction related projects in the state. In order to expedite the EC process, the Ministry has launched a single window online PARIVESH portal which automates the entire process of EC starting from submission of application, preparation of agenda, and preparation of minutes to grant of clearances. Further various initiatives have been taken to amend the policies and regulations to ensure transparent and simplified process of EC without compromising on rigor of the environmental concerns. Due to various efforts taken by Government towards streamlining the EC procedure, overall time taken in grant of EC has been coming down steadily.

The major objectives of the introduction project were:\\n1) To establish breeding cheetah populations in safe habitats across its historic range and manage them as a metapopulation,\\n2) To use the cheetah as a charismatic flagship and umbrella species to garner resources for restoring open forest and savanna systems that will benefit biodiversity and ecosystem services from these ecosystems,\\n3) To use the ensuing opportunity for eco-development and eco-tourism to enhance local community livelihoods and\\n4) To manage any conflict by cheetah or other wildlife with local communities within cheetah conservation areas expediently through compensation, awareness, and management action. In this context, the Government of India initiated G2G consultative meetings with Republic of Namibia which culminated in the signing of MoU between the two countries on 20th July 2022 for cheetah conservation. Following the signing of MoU, in a historic first wild to wild intercontinental translocation, eight cheetahs were transported from Namibia to India on 17th September, 2022 and were released into the quarantine bomas by the Prime Minister of India. As per the Action Plan for Cheetah Introduction in India, annually 10-12 cheetahs are required to be imported from African countries for the next 5 years at least. In this context, the Government of India initiated bilateral negotiations with Republic of South Africa since 2021 for cooperation in the field of Cheetah conservation. The negotiations were successfully concluded with the signing of MoU with the Republic of South Africa in January 2023. Under the provisions of the MoU, a first batch of 12 cheetahs (7 males, 5 females) were translocated from South Africa to India on 18th February 2023. The translocation of 12 cheetahs from South Africa to Gwalior and onwards to Kuno National Park through Helicopters was executed by the Indian Air Force. A delegation of cheetah experts, veterinarians and senior officials accompanied the cheetahs during the transcontinental translocation exercise. For taking India’s ambitious project on Cheetah Introduction forward, a consultative workshop involving international cheetah experts, scientists, veterinarians, and forest officials was also organised on 20th February, 2023 at the Kuno National Park. The outcome of the workshop paved a way for better cheetah management which will help in successfully establishing cheetah metapopulation in India.

The workshop is fourth in the series of regional workshops (previously held in Srinagar, Goa, and Kochi) under Mission Sahbhagita. The Sahbhagita mission aims to conserve and effectively manage a network of 75 wetlands of national and international importance in the country with an all-inclusive ‘whole of society’ and ‘whole of government’ approach. During the workshop Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change\\xa0 Shri Bhupender Yadav interacted with the site managers and the State Wetland Authorities (SWAs) of the North-eastern states of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura, to understand the priorities and challenges of wetlands conservation at their respective states/sites. The Union Minister emphasised that wise use of wetlands aligned with its natural ecology is critical for survival of these ecosystems. Highlighting the importance of multi-stakeholder approach Shri Yadav said “different agencies should come together and collaborate for wetlands conservation”. Shri Yadav stated, “wetlands often get neglected as public goods. The entire society needs to come together to protect these ecosystems”. He also emphasised that change in personal behaviours is the most important aspect if we have to conserve the wetlands. Mission LiFE is critical for nudging people for conserving wetlands. Shri Yadav mentioned that the conservation of wetlands cannot be the government's responsibility alone. Wetlands are essentially societal assets, with governments acting as a trustee of these assets on behalf of the citizens of India. Unless the entire society participates and partners in wetlands conservation, tangible change cannot be achieved ,he added.

Speaking at the Plenary Session at the G7 Ministers' Meeting on Climate, Energy and Environment in Sapporo, Japan he said it is therefore important that we address issues related to climate change in tandem with environmental action, holistically.

In response to these challenges, Rio Conventions have made remarkable progress, through a consensus driven approach, based on principles, he said. Shri Yadav said very recently at the CBD conference in Montreal we adopted the Global Biodiversity Framework and at CoP27 at Sharm el Sheikh, landmark decisions on issues like the Loss and Damage fund were taken. However, there still is a long way to go. The Union Minister said India in its Presidency of G-20, for example, has taken this approach and embedded mitigation and adaptation deeply across priority areas of arresting land degradation, accelerating ecosystem restoration, and enriching biodiversity. He said the approach promotes a sustainable and climate resilient blue economy; encouraging resource efficiency and circular economy; with Lifestyle for Environment (LiFE) as a cross-cutting theme, thus mainstreaming climate change, and addressing the impacts in an ambitious, decisive and action-oriented manner. Shri Yadav said India has been part of providing solutions, while it historically has not been part of any of the problems. He said India has rather taken strong domestic actions, set challenging ambitious targets for itself and is also steering international actions through various initiatives. Shri Yadav said India’s approach has been focused on the convergence of the issues related to Climate Change, Biodiversity loss and pollution. This has reflected in taking up initiatives based on specific interventions through International Solar Alliance (ISA), Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), Lead IT. The Union Minister said India has also focused on action by all, including individual and community actions through Mission LiFE. Changing individual and community behaviour alone can make a significant dent in the environmental and climate crises. Shri Yadav said the recently launched International Big Cat alliance, on the occasion of 50 years of Project Tiger, is rooted in the fact that conserving big cats and their habitats can secure some of the most important natural ecosystems on Earth leading to natural climate change adaptation, water, and food security for millions of people, and provide livelihood and sustenance to forest communities. Shri Yadav said it will be important to ensure country-driven approach along with the principles of equity and CBDR-RC to undertake decisive action. At the same time the voice of the global South needs to be recognised for a truly global leadership of G7 and to receive valuable inputs towards implementation of G7 initiatives. He said this approach will ensure that while we take decisions impacting the whole world, we leave no one behind. Shri Yadav said we look forward to the leadership of G7 Nations to ensure an effective fight against the triple challenges of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, for unity of purpose and unity of action conscious of the fact that we have One Earth, we are One Family and have One Future.

He said over-exploitation of natural resources has also led to widespread environmental degradation. This has come at the cost of altering the balance of nature, putting at serious risk the existence of Planet Earth, he added. Shri Yadav said to save our planet from the challenges of climate change, pollution, loss of biodiversity, we need collective action guided by the founding principles of the Rio Conventions. He said we have made some progress collectively through the process of UNFCCC, CBD, UNCCD. However, there is an urgent need for greater action to deal with the three challenges of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, he added. The Union Minister said developing Countries also need the means of implementation, finance and technology. He said we do hope that the Developed Countries will make good their commitments on finance for combatting climate change and provide for the same for dealing with the environmental degradation and biodiversity loss. Shri Yadav said reaching targets on carbon neutrality and increased ambition will not fly unless they are made keeping Equity and CBDR-RC consideration in view as well as unless the Developed Countries meet their commitments to provide means of implementation. Shri Yadav said our actions have so far focused on creating a policy framework to combat climate change. It is time that governments across the world focus on making this a participative process at the level of individuals. The Union Minister said individual actions have the potential of a revolution. At COP 27 in Sharm el Sheikh, the importance of sustainable lifestyles and sustainable patterns of consumption and production to combat climate change was underscored.

The nature, behavior, mental state of the elephant is very similar to that of a human being and elephants easily express feelings of love, anger, laughter, mockery, etc. \"If we want to preserve this very intelligent animal that has very sharp senses which can recognize odors up to seven kilometers away and communicate with each other for up to seven kilometers through sound waves that the human ear cannot hear, it will take at least five years for the efforts we start today to succeed.\"\\n\\nShinde further said that we should remember that we will be safe in our homes only when the elephant is safe in its home, He added that the genetic memory of the elephant lasts for five generations. That\\'s why in some areas where there was never an elephant in the past, elephants suddenly appear and we are surprised. In such a situation, it is likely that earlier generations of elephants lived there, and the present generations of elephants are traversing that area using the genetic memory of geography of that area, but we are unaware of that.

These cooperative Banks have been found to be engaged in routing of funds of various business entities of their customers, in a manner, so as to abet them to evade their tax liabilities. A total of 16 premises were covered in the search action. A large number of incriminating evidences in the form of hard copy documents and soft copy data have been found and seized during the search action. The seized evidences revealed that these Cooperative Banks were involved in rampantly discounting bearer cheques issued by various business entities, in the name of various fictitious non-existing entities. These business entities included contractors, real estate companies, etc. No KYC norms were followed while discounting such bearer cheques. The amounts after discounting were credited in the bank accounts of certain Cooperative Societies maintained with these Cooperative Banks. It was also detected that some Cooperative Societies subsequently withdrew funds in cash from their accounts and returned the cash to business entities. The purpose of such discounting of large number of cheques was to mask the real source of the cash withdrawal, and to enable the business entities to book bogus expenses. In this modus operandi, Cooperative Societies have been used as a conduit. Further, by using this modus operandi these business entities were also circumventing the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961, which limits the allowable business expenditure incurred other than by account payee cheque. Bogus expenditure booked in this way by these beneficiary business entities, could be to the tune of about Rs 1,000 crore. During the search, it was also found that these Cooperative Banks allowed opening FDRs by using cash deposits without adequate due diligence, and subsequently sanctioned loan using the same as collateral. Evidence seized during the search revealed that unaccounted cash loans of over Rs 15 crore have been given to certain persons/customers. It was also unearthed during the search action that the management of these Cooperative banks have indulged in generating unaccounted money through their real estate & other businesses. This unaccounted money, has been brought back in the books of account, by multiple layering, through these banks. Further, the bank funds were routed, without following due diligence, through various firms and entities owned by the management persons, for their personal use. The search action has resulted in seizure of unaccounted cash of over Rs 3.3 crore and unaccounted gold jewellery worth over Rs 2 crore. Further investigations are under progress.'),\n",

The unified portal of Central Bureau of Narcotics will instill the efficiency, transparency and accountability in department users with twin objective to cater the need of pharma and chemical industry for synergistic growth of the drugs & pharma sector and boosting economy for “Aatma Nirbhar Bharat” and ensure availability of the “essential narcotic drugs” and medicines to the patients & their attendant families. The launch of Unified portal of Central Bureau of Narcotics will prove as a stepping stone in ease of doing business of NDPS and Controlled substances in the country with transparent and better compliance. This portal is calibrated to have database integration & ingestion with other government services including Bharat Kosh, GST, PAN- NSDL validation, e-Sanchit, and UIDAI facilitating single point services for obtaining the licenses from CBN. The exporter, importer, and manufacturer of Narcotic Drugs, Psychotropic Substances, and Controlled Substances are expected to be benefitted in a manner and ecosystem which supports and harbours user-friendly, secure transactions, cloud-based storage, simplified process for applicants to obtain various licenses such as Import Certificates, Export Authorizations, No Objection Certificate for various NDPS and controlled substances, manufacturing licenses, Quota Allocation of Narcotic Drugs in a smooth, hassle-free and transparent operations. It is imperative to note that all the operations are envisaged to be faceless & contactless. The applicants may file applications from anywhere & anytime 24*7 basis eliminating the need of physical interaction and can raise queries with the department which shall be responded through portal. This will leverage drastic reduction in ‘processing-time’ and conserving the resources of the trade for other fruitful business activities. Central Bureau of Narcotics is a central government organization dealing with the international trade of Narcotic Drugs, Psychotropic Substances, and Precursor Chemicals under the ambit of various United Nations Conventions and the provisions of NDPS Act, 1985. These substances bear dual potential as strong medicinal, scientific, and industrial use as well as a diversion for illicit use creating the substances for abuse. Therefore, there is a need for striking a fine balance between the availability of these substances to the people and maintaining compliance with the law in this regard. These challenges envisioned the Bureau to conceptualize the use of a Digital platform as an effective tool to synergize and sustain balance between facilitation and compliance management. ****\\nPPG/KMN\\n'),\n",

However, this is a fact that there has been some demand and supply gap observed in the dairy sector- primarily due to increased demand for nutritious, safe and hygienic milk and milk products post COVID-19 pandemic. To meet the growing demand and considering the fact that the supply of milk in the ensuing summer season being a lean season may be less, there were demands from several dairy cooperatives for import of conserved dairy commodities – milk fat and powder. With this background, NDDB along with Government of India has been monitoring the demand-supply situation. Since the process of import takes time, the necessary back end processes are being put in place to timely manage the situation in case of any eventuality. In case the situation warrants, the import may be done to help ease out the situation for the dairy cooperatives to meet the summer demands. However, in that case also it will be ensured that it is routed only through NDDB and the needy Unions may be given the stocks at the market price after proper assessment. This will ensure that the market is not distorted and interests of our dairy farmer is protected, which is paramount and central to any decision taken by the Government. The article that Hon’ble MP Shri Sharad Pawar ji is referring to in his letter addressed to Minister of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries Shri Purushottam Rupala, which is available in public domain, \\xa0only states that a decision will be taken after watching the demand-supply position later in the summer, which inter alia means that no final decision has been taken in this regard. **********\\nNB/RKM\\n'),\n",

This initiative is expected to provide better clinical exposure to nursing students and will also result in better care and service provision for patients in medical colleges. Use of green technologies will also be explored in these Nursing colleges and will be adopted as per relevancy to ensure energy efficiency and reduction in carbon footprint. The Government plans to complete the project within next two years and has laid out detailed timelines for every stage of planning as well as execution of the project. The Empowered Committee headed by the Union Health Secretary in the Centre and Principal Secretary, Health/Medical Education in the States will monitor the progress of the work. The State Government/UTs will intimate to MoHFW on regular basis, the physical progress of the works being done for the establishment of new nursing colleges under the scheme. Background:\\nThere has been tremendous focus of this government to ensure quality healthcare workforce with substantial increase in their numbers. The Government has increased number of medical colleges and subsequently increased MBBS seats in last few years. There is substantial increase of\\xa0 around 71% in Medical Colleges from 387 before 2014 to 660 as of now. Further, the number of MBBS seats have almost doubled and Post Graduate seats have more than doubled since 2013-14. The services of Indian Nurses are considerably recognized in foreign countries, so it is important to bring Indian nursing education at par with the global standards in order to facilitate their mobility and better employment opportunities. They are recognized as highly skilled professionals and drive the healthcare delivery system, but their numerical strength is below global norms and needs to be adequately enhanced. *****\\nDS\\n'),\n",

The latest measure promises to support ease of use for all new FBO’s in applying for licenses. As a result, more than 1.2 crore have registered FBOs for license renewal. For the purpose of making the food safety ecosystem robust and facilitating wider reach, FSSAI has initiated many user-friendly features in the application, of which the first step is making it available in all other regional languages for license and registration purposes. This will also result in a boost in traffic and revenue, expand reachability and deliver a world-class experience. The availability of the FOSCOS application in Hindi and all regional languages will also help the FBOs in getting a better understanding of the Food Safety Compliance System.

Since its inception, the service has aimed to create a digital mental health ecosystem that has provided a boost to the existing mental healthcare services. An urgent need was felt for a digital mental health network in the wake of COVID and Tele-MANAS aimed to provide the same by giving access to the mental healthcare services 24X7 to even in the remotest part of the country. These services are available for all individuals free-of-cost through a toll-free number 14416 / 1800-89-14416. The nation-wide service, an initiative of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India successfully completed its first 6 months of functioning, with currently over 38 functional Tele MANAS Cells spread across 27 States and UTs, providing mental health services in over 20 languages and over 1600 trained counsellors running the first-line services. Most of the calls received at Tele MANAS thus far, are from callers calling regarding sadness of mood, stress related calls, exam related anxiety, domestic disturbances and calls regarding sleep disturbances. Tele MANAS initiative which was announced by Union Ministry of Health & Family Welfare in the Union budget 2022-23 as an acknowledgement to the mental health crisis in the country, is a novel initiative to enable people to seek support for their mental health issues while maintaining anonymity of the callers, thereby reducing the stigma generally surrounding mental health issues. The National Tele Mental Health Programme of India focusses on building the mental health workforce of the nation through capacity building initiatives whilst simultaneously ensuring that mental health services can reach free of cost to every household and every individual, targeting the most vulnerable and unreached sections of society that may otherwise have gone unnoticed. With Tele MANAS reaching the 1 lakh mark in 6 months, it turns a new leaf in achieving its ultimate aim of building a robust digital mental health network throughout India. ****\\nMV\\nHFW/Tele-MANAS Achievement/24thApril2023/2\\n\"),\n",

Goa’s achievements in immunization and the implementation of the STEMI project were presented to the media delegation comprising representatives from both national and local media. STEMI – Goa project was launched by the Government of Goa in collaboration with Tricog Health Services, Pvt. Ltd. Bengaluru with an aim to reduce premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by one-third by adopting advanced health practices and modern technology. ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) is a type of heart attack that happens when the blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked. Under the project, a hub and spoke model has been put in place where any Tertiary care hospital with Cath lab facilities acts as a hub while public health facilities identified under the STEMI Project to stabilize the patient before referral are spokes. Every spoke is equipped with a Tricog ECG machine linked to a Tele-ECG facility and CardioNet App which connects the data to a team of cardiologists in Bengaluru. This ensures that ECG reports are generated in under 5 minutes. The project also has for provisions for a cardiac ambulance, for patient referral from spoke to the HUB if required, with live tracking of patient transfer enabled. With this model average time for treatment of a heart attack patient is reduced and brought closer to the ‘golden hour’ of 90 minutes, saving countless lives. The project was initially started with one government Hub and 12 existing peripheral government hospitals being the spokes, and has now expanded to 4 Hubs\\xa0 and 20 spokes. The immunization program implemented by the state government was also showcased, at the Moira Sub Centre of the Aldona PHC. The system is an excellent example of a well-organized and effective use of technology to ensure that every child is immunized in a timely. Under the model, following the birth of a baby, digital and print records are maintained to keep track of their immunization schedule. The parents of the child are reminded of the upcoming doses through phone calls. If the parents are out of town, they are advised to visit the nearest health center to receive the vaccine or are given the dose on their arrival at the health center. Dr. Mangesh, Health Officer, UNICEF highlighted the importance of Immunization services by noting how they act as a bridge in connecting health facilities and communities. He added that Immunization outreach activities can contribute to strengthening Primary Health Care services even in rural villages and urban slums that face barriers in accessing health care services. He stated that UNICEF supports the Government of India’s immunization programs, in reaching missed/drop-out children toward achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and accelerating Sustainable Development Goals focused on Health\\n\\nAddressing the media delegation, Health Secretary, Government of Goa, Arun Mishra stated that Goa was moving from strength to strength in modernization of health services. He added that he expects the entire population of the state to be covered under Ayushman Bharat Health Accounts by July, this year. He further stated that the high utilization of telemedicine services in Goa establishes that the state has an efficient model of digital health services in place. India’s G20 Presidency has identified three priorities in the Health track, namely Health emergencies prevention and preparedness; strengthening cooperation in the pharmaceutical sector and Digital health innovation & solutions. The media tour has helped demonstrate how medical services in Goa are setting an example towards achieving India’s G20 priorities under Health track. * * *\\nPIB Panaji | Gautam SK/S.Thakur/D.Rane\\nFollow us on social media:@PIBMumbai\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0/PIBMumbai\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0/pibmumbai\\xa0\\xa0pibmumbai[at]gmail[dot]com\\xa0 /PIBMumbai\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0/pibmumbai\\nFollow us on social media:\\n'),\n",

This initiative is being taken up as a pilot project to create an example for other such streets to come up across the country for ensuring hygienic and safe food practices. The aim of this project is to encourage safe and healthy food practices among food businesses and community members, thus, reducing foodborne illnesses and improving the overall health outcomes. In a letter to states, Shri Rajesh Bhushan, Union Health Secretary and Shri Manoj Joshi, Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs Secretary have highlighted that “Easy access to safe and hygienic food is vital for the good health of citizens. Safe food practices not only promote “eat right campaign” and food safety, but will improve hygiene credibility of local food businesses, boost local employment, tourism and in turn, economy. It also leads to a cleaner and greener environment.”\\nStreet foods have traditionally been an integral part of Indian society and are present all across the Country. They represent the rich local tradition of cuisine. Street foods not only provide daily diet at affordable prices to millions but also provide direct employment to a large number of people and also support the tourism industry. Food Safety and Hygiene at street food outlets & hubs remain a matter of concern. With rapid urbanization, while these hubs have led to easy access to food, this has also aggravated the issue of food contamination & associated health issues due to unhygienic and unsafe food practices. This unique initiative will be implemented through National Health Mission (NHM) in convergence with Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs & with technical support from FSSAI. The financial assistance for the initiative to States/UTs in the form of Rs.1 crore per food street/districts will be given to fill up critical gaps. 100 such food streets will be opened up in 100 districts across the country (List given below). This assistance will be provided under National Health Mission (NHM) in the ratio of 60:40 or 90: 10 with the condition that standard branding of these food streets will be done as per FSSAI guidelines. Municipal Corporations/Development Authorities/ District Collectors at the state level will take major initiatives to ensure convergence in terms of financial resources & physical infrastructure. Various other initiatives such as training of food handlers, independent third party audits, and certification of Eat Right Street Food Hubs \\'SOP for Modernisation of Food Streets\\', have been taken to enhance food safety standards. Schemes like \"Support to Urban Street Vendors (SUSV)\", a component of Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana- National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAYNULM), Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs have also been taken up. In addition, States/UTs can also conduct training programmes for street vendors to orient them on aspects vis. food safety, maintenance of hygiene, and waste disposal. S.N.'),\n",

A robust monitoring system based on consultative approach was established through the State Steering Committee, State Task Force, District Task Force, Block/Urban Task Force with a two-way feedback mechanism to ensure swift mid-course corrective measures. Operational Guidelines detailing about the technicalities of COVID vaccination and Communication Strategy addressing vaccine hesitancy and eagerness on COVID-19 Vaccination were prepared and shared with all states and UTs. Following scientific prioritization, the programme initially began with vaccinating 1.04 crore Health Care Workers, followed by Front Line Workers and the vulnerable population aged 60 years and above, increasing the cohort to nearly 30 crores. It was further expanded in a phased manner to cover the population cohort of 106. 02 crore comprising of those aged 12 years and above, comparable to the population size of several countries together. Since the programme was initiated on 16th January 2021, it has completed 825 days till date. Capacity building played a crucial role in ensuring safe delivery of vaccines. Cascaded training of all stakeholders was conducted on a humungous scale and in record time even during COVID surges through a combination of virtual (for the first time till the district level) as well as classroom trainings (sub-district level) and the quality of trainings was monitored using certain pre-fixed key indicators. Nearly 75,000 Programme Officers/Medical Officers, 7,30,000 Health Workers and 1,60,000 additional Frontline Workers were oriented on various aspects of vaccination programme including those in private sector and health services under other organizations. Approximately 2.64 lakh vaccinators and 4.76 lakh other vaccination team members were trained on the key components of COVID vaccination. More than 1,00,000 users trained on using Co-WIN platform in 700+ districts. Development of Co-WIN (Winning over COVID) platform for facilitating a smooth vaccination roll-out was critical in the success of the programme. The IT platform was based on the 5 core principles: inclusivity, accessibility, equity, transparency and scalability. It enabled real time monitoring of status of vaccination drive, vaccine availability and utilization. It facilitated the beneficiaries in self-registration, advance booking of vaccination appointments and availability of QR based individual digital certificates. The innovative digital platform has been modified and customized with the evolving guidelines from time to time. It was ensured that the process of registration and vaccination remains simple, transparent and hassle-free. The Co-WIN platform was a key factor in enabling India to achieve multiple milestones in vaccination which includes:\\nS.No. Date\\nDoses administered\\nNo. of Vaccinators\\nNo. of active CVCs\\n1\\n27/8/2021\\n1.09 crore\\n56,035\\n57,399\\n2\\n31/8/2021\\n1.42 crore\\n68,273\\n70,017\\n3\\n6/9/2021\\n1.21 crore\\n65,589\\n67,183\\n4\\n17/9/2021\\n2.51 crore\\n98,184\\n1,01,164\\n5\\n20/9/2021\\n1.01 crore\\n63,763\\n65,590\\n6\\n27/9/2021\\n1.08 crore\\n69,876\\n71,519\\n7\\n4/12/2021\\n1.12 crore\\n83,017\\n85,058\\n8\\n3/1/2022\\n1.07 crore\\n92,546\\n95,128\\n9\\n4/1/2022\\n1.03 crore\\n87,956\\n90,335\\n10\\n6/1/2022\\n1.01 crore\\n89,338\\n91,330\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInspired from Mission Indradhanush, two rounds of ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ Teekakaran Abhiyaan were conducted to cover the missed-out and dropped-out beneficiaries in a campaign mode. ‘COVID Vaccination Amrit Mahotsav’ was another campaign that sustained the momentum and helped prevent any further surge in new cases by organized camps at various locations such as routes of public and private offices, religious yatra’s, industrial establishments etc.\"),\n",

Thus, showcasing the right trajectory country is taking towards achieving milestones of Universal Health Coverage”, this was stated by Dr. Vinod K. Paul, Member (Health) of NITI Aayog as he launched National Health Accounts (NHA) Estimates for India for 2019-20 in the presence of Shri Rajesh Bhushan, Secretary, Union Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. Highlighting the efforts of the government towards public investments in the health sector, findings from National Health Accounts (NHA) show that various indicators have demonstrated an encouraging trend on a sustained basis. While congratulating everyone on NHA Estimates report launch, Dr. V K Paul, Member (Health) NITI Aayog stated that “Government is ensuring that healthcare services that are required, be made readily available and accessible to the citizens without financial hardships.” Highlighting investments in strengthening primary healthcare, Dr. Paul said that “report highlights the increased public spending in primary healthcare, which is in line with National Health policy 2017 where it states that two-thirds of public health spending must be in Primary Health systems. This is also a result of great developments/initiatives taken at grassroot level such as opening of over 1.6 lakh Ayushman Bharat Health and Wellness Centres (AB-HWCs) which are providing plethora of health services to the people.” He further said that primary healthcare must be prioritized as it is the fundamental base on which secondary and tertiary services can be supported efficiently. Dr. Paul expressed his heartfelt appreciation to the teams working behind this report and noted the significance of an accurate record of data collected for an evidence-based decision making. He said that “these estimates are crucial for policymaking and comparing various indicators further aids in reflecting the progress made by the health system of the country.”\\nDr. Paul also threw light on the fact that private health insurance share is also going up. He said that “this shows a sign of maturity for a country in terms of insurance arena as those who can afford, will afford it from private players too. This complements the government system of primary, secondary and tertiary care.”\\n\\nFigure 1: Share of Private Health Expenditure at various levels (%)\\nThe NHA estimates for 2019-20 which is seventh in the series of reports released annually, clearly show that government expenditure for healthcare continues to be the priority. The share of Out-of-Pocket Expenditure (OOPE) in total Health Expenditure (THE) declined from 62.6% to 47.1%. The continuous decline in the OOPE in the overall health spending show progress towards ensuring financial protection and Universal Health Coverage for citizens. Figure 2: Government Health Expenditure and Out-of-pocket expenditure as % of Total Health Expenditure (%)\\nDuring this period, the share of Government Health Expenditure (GHE) in the overall GDP of the country has increased from 1.13% in 2014-15 to 1.35% in 2019-20. Figure 3: Government Health Expenditure as % of GDP\\nIn per capita terms, GHE has doubled from Rs. 1,108 to Rs. 2,014 between 2014-15 to 2019-20. The government spending on health between 2018-19 and 2019-20 increased by 12%, more than double the growth rate between 2017-18 and 2018-19 which was at 5%. Additionally, in General Government Expenditure (GGE), the share of health sector spending has steadily increased from 3.94% to 5.02% between 2014-15 and 2019-20. This clearly indicates that healthcare has been the priority for public investment in the country. Figure 4: Government Health Expenditure as % of General Government Expenditure (GGE)\\nThe increase in government spending on health has an important implication for the reduction of financial hardship endured by households. In the Total Health Expenditure (THE) of the country between 2014-15 and 2019-20, the share of GHE has increased from 29% to 41.4%. The share of primary healthcare in Current Government Health Expenditure (CGHE) has increased from 51.3% in 2014-15 to 55.9% in 2019-20. The increased focus on primary healthcare reinforces the government’s decisions to prioritize primary healthcare in the country. Figure 5: Share of Primary Health Care in Current Government Health Expenditure (%)\\nAnother positive trend in the country’s health financing space is the increase in Social Security Expenditure (SSE) on healthcare. This increase in social security has a direct impact on reducing out-of-pocket payments. A robust social security mechanism ensures that individuals will not face financial hardship and the risk of poverty as a consequence of accessing essential healthcare services. The share of SSE on health, which includes government-funded health insurance, medical reimbursement to government employees, and social health insurance programs, in THE, has increased from 5.7% in 2014-15 to 9.3% in 2019-20. Figure 6: Social Security Expenditure on Health as % of Total Health Expenditure (%)\\n\\nWhile thanking the huge participation of state officials and other stakeholders, Dr. Paul also highlighted the persistent efforts in increasing total public spending on health at state level. He thus, urged the state governments to move ahead in healthcare spending as percentage of their total budget to about 8% which is currently 4-5% for many states. He further added that “this spending must be in line with the bigger picture of benefiting the citizens”. Union Health Secretary Shri Rajesh Bhushan highlighted four important indicators i.e. reduced out of pocket expenditure due to which people are now spending less from their pockets.” “This is also a consequence of the increased government health spending over the years, he further stated. Shri Bhushan informed everyone about government spending through services at AB-HWCs, insurance claims etc. While highlighting that the significance of promotive and preventive health, Shri Bhushan said that “we need to persist with this trend of expenditure on primary healthcare so that promotive and preventive health, which mostly take place at primary level, can be focused upon.”\\nUnion Health Secretary also pointed out about social security expenditure, which includes the social health insurance program, government-financed health insurance schemes, and medical reimbursements made to government employees, has drastically increased from 5% to 9.3%. “This along with other indicators taken together highlight that the burden on an individual or family due to health issues have reduced”, he added.'),\n",

NHA announced HCX as a new initiative under the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) on 23rd September 2022 and subsequently worked with various groups to come up with Health Insurance Exchange specifications. The current health insurance claims settlement process in the country is mostly manual, non-digital and laborious in nature posing challenges at every stage. The current process of exchanging claims lacks standardization across the ecosystem with most data exchange occurring through PDF/manual methods and processes vary significantly among Insurers, TPAs, and Providers leading to high cost of processing each claim. To tackle these key challenges and streamline the process of claim settlement, NHA has developed a national Health Claims Exchange (HCX) to enable interoperability of health claims. The HCX serves as a protocol for exchanging claims-related information among various actors, including payers, providers, beneficiaries, regulators, and observers. It is designed to be interoperable, machine-readable, auditable, and verifiable which helps ensure that the information being exchanged is accurate and trustworthy. HCX will act as a gateway (with validation and routing capabilities) for the ecosystem wherein the Insurers/ TPAs shall send responses for each FHIR based e-claim submitted by providers via the HCX through standard protocols (APIs). With a vision to standardize the claims process, HCX will lead to reduction in operational overheads and increase the trust among payers and providers through a transparent and rule-based mechanism, it will reduce claims processing cost, expedite pre-authorization or patient discharge approvals, improve patient experience, better visibility for tracking the claims and have better quality data for industry and regulators. To ensure the success and adoption of the claims network, it is essential to onboard participants on the HCX ecosystem, therefore it is requested that all interested solution providers, payers, and provider to actively participate and utilize the services of the HCX – Sandbox, the key goal of the sandbox is to help the ecosystem test its specific components against the communication standards and get certified to become a part of the system. Once a participant successfully completes the sandbox process, they can use the certification to get onboarded to the HCX production environment with the necessary access. The interested participants can submit an online application to express their interest to access the HCX sandbox on https://sbxhcx.abdm.gov.in/. On successful verification, the approved participants are added to the HCX sandbox and provisioned with the necessary credentials to access the sandbox environment. The link also provides all necessary documentation for participation along with the HCX specifications and FHIR profiles. The FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) for ABDM has been updated to support HCX specifications. The preview of the IG is hosted at - https://www.nrces.in/preview/ndhm/fhir/r4/hcx-profile.html. ****\\nMV/RDJ\\nHFW/NHA/ABDM/HCX Sandbox participation/18th April 2023\\n'),\n",

Union Health Minister Dr Mansukh Mandaviya along with Dr. Bharti Pravin Pawar, Minister of State for Health & Family Welfare, led the walkathon. The event was organised under the theme of ‘Health for All’. The aim of the walkathon was to create awareness about healthy habits not only to keep away Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) but also for positive effects on mental wellbeing. The event started from Vijay Chowk via Kartavya Path and passed through India Gate to reach Nirman Bhawan. Over 350 enthusiastic participants, walking for better health, participated with great fervour. They took a pledge to adopt healthy and active living to prevent and control lifestyle-related health problems/ diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, mental illness and cancer. In a tweet, Union Health Minister, Dr. Mansukh Mandaviya reiterated the Hon’ble Prime Minister’s vision of a Healthier India. \"It is health that is real wealth, not pieces of gold & silver.\" - Mahatma GandhiOn #WorldHealthDay, we reiterate our commitment towards building a healthier India.Take a look at how PM @NarendraModi Ji\\'s Govt has been working relentlessly towards ensuring Health For All 👇 pic.twitter.com/6UAB57A00O\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpeaking on the occasion, Dr. Mansukh Mandaviya thanked everyone for their participation in the event. He said that “It has remained India’s philosophy of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam where we think about the progress for all and not just self. This philosophy was observed during the COVID crisis, when India provided vaccines and medical supplies to the countries in need without considering any commercial profits. India has been at the forefront of helping every stakeholder, and with this spirit, India is working for the health of its citizens and the world.”\\nHighlighting the significance of health in country’s development, Dr. Mandaviya stated that “under the leadership of the Prime Minister, India has connected health to development. Only healthy citizens can create a healthy society and, in turn, a developed nation. In this Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav, I urge you all to work together to create a developed and healthy India.”\\nThe Union Minister of State for Health & Family Welfare, Dr. Bharati Pravin Pawar noted that “be it a walkathon, yoga or other exercises, our youth is enthusiastically inculcating these physical activities in their lives.” She said that the “Health for all” concept originates from the fact that a healthy person not only contributes positively to their family but also to society. She also noted that the country took a strong resolve under the leadership of the Hon’ble Prime Minister for a fit India, where behavioural changes and a more physically active lifestyle are being encouraged. The World Health Day aims to promote awareness among people towards importance of good health. Reiterating this message from time to time, Union Health Minister Dr. Mansukh Mandaviya, who is also known as a “Green MP” for his enthusiasm for cycling, has been encouraging citizens to adopt a healthier lifestyle. It is known that NCDs account currently for more than 63% of all deaths in the country and are strongly associated and causally linked with major behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use (smoking and smokeless), alcohol use, poor dietary habits, insufficient physical activity, and air pollution. One of the major risk factors for development of NCDs is physical inactivity. According to the National NCD Monitoring Survey (NNMS) (2017-18) as well, 41.3% of Indians are physically inactive. Physical activity not only lowers the risk of NCDs including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, cancer etc. but also has positive effects on mental health, delays the onset of dementia.

In line with the G20 India Presidency\\'s theme of \"Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,\" or \"One Earth, One Family, One Future,\"\\xa0 the discussions emphasized India\\'s commitment to \"healthcare for all\" through vibrant global and local collaborations. Three panel discussions were held, with the first session focusing on \"Innovations in Healthcare - Health service delivery aided by Technology Interventions.\" The session saw eminent health experts pushing for a lifecycle-care framework where open-source software can enable data innovations. Suggestions such as a central organization/coalition in the world to guide national governments, along with regional implementation hubs, paradigm shift towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and AGI-enabled Digital public goods were put forward. Stakeholders also echoed concerted efforts to demystify technology and build trust among citizens through data privacy legislations and other checks, with interventions shared by G20 member states and invitee countries, showcasing their best practices and ongoing efforts towards utilizing digital health in their health governance. The second session on \"Technology aiding Continuing of care - Harnessing the potential of real-world data/evidence for better patient outcomes\" explored various thought-provoking aspects of technological tools and how they can be used in better patient care delivery. It was discussed that highly interoperable systems are needed, and for national digital transformation, nations must focus on a person-centered digital journey. Suggestions such as cooperation among tech innovators, governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and health organizations, combined with strong political will and a coordinated and inclusive framework to guide investments, were discussed. Best practices from India, such as the National NCD portal for tracking non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and e-Sanjeevani teleconsultation services, were also showcased. The third session on \"Digital Public Goods (DPGs) to bridge the Digital Divide\" highlighted the critical element of democratizing digital public goods. The speakers concurred that investments in DPGs can reap multifold benefits, and in addition to DPGs, it was suggested that expert knowledge facilitated by digital interventions must be democratized as well. It was noted that governance and policy help scale DPGs nationally and internationally, while technology helps scale DPGs at the local and regional levels. Thus, robust health data governance can remove bottlenecks to the development of a global digital health ecosystem. It was also noted that the care is universal, and making user-intuitive platforms according to local needs must remain a priority. Several other important suggestions, such as collective action to promote the Global Initiative on Digital Health (GIDH), strengthening organizational capacities across the globe, and developing lightweight standards for Public Health Centers for better and faster adoption at grassroots levels, were discussed in the session. On the conclusion of the side event, participants thanked the G20 Presidency of India for providing the platform where these ideas could be efficiently shared. Keynote speakers included experts from the industry, international organizations, non-governmental organizations, startups, hospital networks, and governments.

He underlined that “when it comes to talent, the world has seen the impact of Indian doctors. Both in India and outside, our doctors are widely respected for their competence and commitment. Similarly, nurses and other caregivers from India are also well known. There are many healthcare systems across the world which benefit from the talent of Indian professionals. India has tremendous diversity in culture, climate and social dynamics. Healthcare professionals trained in India are exposed to diverse experiences. This helps them develop skills that can meet the needs of different situations. This is why Indian healthcare talent has won the world's trust”. The Prime Minister emphasized that India has a great tradition of preventive and promotive health with Indian practices such as Yoga and meditation now becoming global movements.

These four pillars of Ayushman Bharat are constructed with the intent of providing value-based, patient-centric healthcare”. Dr Mandaviya highlighted that given the acute shortage of the healthcare workforce following COVID-19, Indian healthcare professionals hold great potential to help save lives across borders. He stated that “there have been several success stories of patients all over the globe who have benefited from India’s modern treatments and traditional medicine. The past few years have seen an increase in medical value travel and today, India is being recognized as one of the fastest-growing medical value travel destinations not only in Asia but also in the world. This can be attributed to the unique blend of modern medicine and traditional systems of medicine that the country has to offer.” “India currently provides support to several developing countries lacking secondary and tertiary care facilities to facilitate capacity building of hospitals so that they can treat patients in their own country and send referrals of special care cases to India”, he further stated. On the role of industry in creating a healthcare ecosystem, Dr Mandaviya emphasized that “our industries play an important role in responsible service delivery. Industry wields the power of technological know-how without which capacity building of workforce and upskilling will remain a distant dream.” “It is the collective efforts of the industry, civil society and associations which will help give a further boost to the Indian Medical Value Travel sector and realize the vision of the Hon’ble Prime Minister to make India the “Destination of Choice” for Medical Value Travel”, he remarked. The Union Health Minister also held bilateral discussions with the visiting Health Ministers from all the 7 countries on the sidelines of the AHCI event. Dr V K Paul stated that India has gained a strong foothold worldwide as the “global medical destination” with Indian MVT market size expected to grow to USD 13 Bn by 2026 from present value of USD 5-6 Bn. Highlighting the multiple initiatives of the Union Government to build a resilient post-pandemic MVT and facilitate treatments of foreign patients to get treated in India, he stated that “India has launched Medical Visa & Medical Attendant Visa with e-medical visas offered to 150+ countries within 24-48 hours. The medical visa process has been simplified to allow multiple entries and long-term stay with Ayurveda treatment having also been included within the Medical Visa category”. Dr Paul also noted that “a Medical Value Travel Council has been constituted by the Government of India to promote India as a quality healthcare destination for patients across the globe.

With this, the applicants under the scheme can now submit their applications for the testing and certification of AAT products (both OEMs and components), which will help them qualify for incentives under the PLI Auto scheme. With this move, the Union Minister of Heavy Industries, Dr. Mahendra Nath Pandey, said that the Ministry is trying to align itself with the Prime Minister\\'s vision of Aatmanirbhar Bharat, and these SOPs will not only help to achieve that but will also help to increase the manufacturing foothold. With this, the ministry aims to boost the domestic manufacturing sector and reduce dependence on imports, thereby creating more job opportunities for Indians. The government is committed to promoting skill development and entrepreneurship in the country, and this initiative will help in achieving that goal. He also added that it would contribute to the overall economic growth of the nation. The scheme is expected to attract significant investments and help India become a global hub for automobile manufacturing. The Ministry of Heavy Industries (MHI) notified the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for Automobile and Auto Component Industry in India (PLI-AUTO Scheme or the Scheme) on September 23, 2021, with a budgetary outlay of 25,938 crores. The PLI-Auto Scheme proposes financial incentives to boost domestic manufacturing of advanced automotive technology (AAT) products and attract investments in the automotive manufacturing value chain. The scheme has two parts: Champion OEM, which will make electric or hydrogen-powered vehicles, and Component Champions, which will make high-value and high-tech components. The objectives of the PLI Scheme:\\nThe key objectives of the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for Automobiles and Auto Components are to provide financial incentives to boost domestic manufacturing of advanced automotive technology products and attract investments in the automotive manufacturing value chain. Its prime objectives include overcoming cost disabilities, creating economies of scale, and building a robust supply chain in areas of advanced automotive technology products. The scheme also aims to generate employment in the country. To facilitate the automobile industry\\'s move up the value chain into higher-value-added products\\nMHI, on November 9, 2021, notified the categories of 19 AAT vehicles and 103 AAT components that shall be covered under the scheme. These components are either advanced or latest-technology automotive components, those for which the supply chain is nonexistent in India, or both. Thus, with this scheme, India will be able to increase its share in the global advanced technology and automotive supply chains. Domestic Value Addition (DVA):\\nAccording to the scheme guidelines, applicants must achieve a DVA of 50% to claim incentives under the scheme. The auto companies and component makers are required to calculate and present the DVA across their supply chain and present these details to the testing agencies. This is being done to promote the Make in India campaign and boost domestic manufacturing of advanced automotive products. Committee for making SOP:\\nA committee headed by Director ARAI Pune was constituted with members comprising all testing agencies, viz., iCAT Manesar, NATRAX, Pune, GARC Chennai, and IFCI (PMA for PLI Auto Scheme), to make an SOP for calculating DVA, or domestic value addition. Accordingly, with this sharing of knowledge and views among the various stakeholders, the committee drafted the SOP after deliberating on all the suggestions received from the stakeholders. Consultations were held with all 85 applicants for the PLI scheme. These include 18 OEMs and 67 auto component manufacturing companies. The list of these companies is attached. Process of consultations:\\nThrough stakeholders’ consultations and continuous discussions, the industry shared various representations and suggestions. Further, the draft SOP was also shared with the stakeholders, including applicant companies, from time to time for their input and feedback. Further, the Committee also carried out a trial DVA calculation exercise with some of the OEM and component applicants on a selective basis. The cross-sectoral learnings from implementing PLI schemes have been adopted by implementing the experience gained by other ministries and departments. These included the Department of Pharmaceuticals (DoP), MNRE, MeiTY, the Department of Expenditure, the Department of Pharmaceuticals, the Ministry of Steel, and other concerned ministries. After 3 rounds of detailed stakeholder consultations, the committee has come up with a draft SOP consisting of a desk appraisal and field visits to the applicants and their suppliers’ manufacturing facilities, a techno-commercial audit of the applicants, and a periodic surveillance assessment, which would provide a greater level of assurance to all the stakeholders. The SOP specifies procedures for the same in sufficient detail. The SOP has now been released by the testing agencies, and this will allow the applicants under the PLI scheme to apply for approval of AAT products (both OEMs and components). Ease of doing business:\\nThe Government of India, with a view to promoting ease of doing business, has taken care to devise simple procedures with the minimum paperwork needed to file an application under the PLI scheme. A direct supplier to an OEM is called a \"tier 1 supplier. Tier 1 suppliers are known as Tier 2 suppliers, and so on. The information with regard to imports up to the Tier 3 level has to be authenticated by the applicants up to the Tier 1 level only. However, no documents up to Tier 3 will be required to be submitted at the time of filing the application. The declarations submitted by the applicants will be adequate for most of the requirements under the scheme. This will reduce the compliance burden on the applicants and promote faster applications and the disbursal of incentives under the scheme. Power to remove difficulties:\\nIn case there are unforeseen circumstances preventing compliance with all provisions contained in the SOP, the testing agencies have been given the power to relax the provisions of the SOP. This will enable a flexible approach to the resolution of issues that may arise in the complex supply chain of the automotive industry. *****\\nAD/NS\\n'),\n",

Three of the six current U20 priority areas (accelerating climate finance, ensuring water security, and encouraging environmentally responsive behavior), were the matter of contention. Participants concurred that it is necessary for cities to accelerate climate action and receive added support from national governments and international investors to address vulnerabilities due to increasing heat and rainfall. They deliberated that the city governments should consider climate impacts when making budgeting decisions, while leveraging public-private partnerships, municipal green bonds and other innovative financing mechanisms where available. Climate action plans should address water security and resilience; institutional and regulatory reforms should be considered where needed to protect and revitalize vulnerable water resources, mainstream integrated urban water resource management, ensure equitable and safe access to water and reduce risk from water-related hazards like flooding. “To create sustainable cities, innovative and inclusive city design is crucial. Without it, behavior nudges and policy changes would not work. Let’s tweak policies, implement congestion pricing, and give incentives for sustainable living. We must also broaden the agenda and create neighborhoods where people can step out and enjoy the city. Telangana’s cool roof policy is a great example. Let’s demystify climate finance for a better future.” said Kunal Kumar, Joint Secretary and Smart Cities Mission Director of Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, Government of India. Shruti Narayan, C40 Regional Director for South and West Asia, said: “Cities across India and the world are stepping up as climate leaders, but they continue to face daunting capacity constraints as they pursue urgently needed climate action. That’s why city voices are so vital on the national and international stage. This gathering serves as a clarion call for leaders around the world to make our climate a priority.”\\nRakesh Singh, Additional Chief Secretary, Urban Development Department, and Government of Karnataka, said: “Bengaluru is leading the way in sustainable urban infrastructure, with a strong focus on public transport, solid waste management, and citizen engagement. Role of civil society is crucial for collaborative and cohesive solutions.”\\nThe conference was organized by the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, together with Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) in Bengaluru on 21 April 2023.

PM praised the one-of-its-kind bioelectricity, biofuel and bio-manure generation project during one of Mann Ki Baat episodes. Stating that the market’s waste is now being turned into wealth, PM said, “We have observed that in sabzi mandis, vegetables rot due to multiple reasons, spreading unhygienic conditions. However, traders at Hyderabad’s Bowenpally Sabzi Mandi decided to produce electricity out of waste vegetables. This is the power of innovation.”\\nA few years ago, generating electricity from vegetable waste would have been a far-fetched idea, but not anymore. Hyderabad’s Bowenpally Vegetable Market has turned this into reality. Nearly 10 tons of waste is collected every day in the market, which earlier used to end up in landfills, but is now the major source of electricity for the vegetable market. Srinivas, Secretary, Bowenpally’s vegetable market, highlighted that every ounce of vegetable and fruit waste collected from this market is used to generate around 500 units of electricity and 30 kg of biofuel. The electricity generated provides electricity to streetlights, 170 stalls, an administration building, and the water supply network. Meanwhile, the biofuel produced is pumped to the market\\'s commercial kitchen. The Biogas plant is now called the \"path to a sustainable future”. The canteen in the market is being run by the electricity generated through the plant established. The market yard requires 650-700 units of power and about 7-8 tons of vegetable waste generated to produce 400 units of electricity on average. As a result, the marketplace is also kept clean and pollution free. Various international delegates have also visited the plant and appreciated our efforts.”\\nBowenpally’s waste-to-energy plant generates employment for women by providing opportunities for them to work in various roles such as sorting and segregating waste, operating machinery, and managing administrative tasks. This plant offers women workers a steady income along with an opportunity for skill development. Rukamini Devamma, a woman employee at the Bowenpally vegetable market says, “बायो-गैस प्लांट लगने से हमें अपने काम के लिए अच्छा भुगतान किया जा रहा है। हमें सभी आवश्यक सुरक्षा गियर जैसे मास्क, गम बूट, दस्ताने आदि भी दिए गए हैं। इस तरह सुरक्षित माहौल मिलने के बाद हम दूसरों को भी अपने साथ जुड़ने और काम करने के लिए प्रोत्साहित कर रहे हैं।\"\\n\\n\\nAccording to Bowenpally market officials, on average, 10 tons of waste is generated per day. This waste has the potential to generate approximately 6,290 kg of CO2 per annum which could be more damaging to the environment.'),\n",

Bowenpally’s Biogas Plant\\nThe waste generated (rotten and unsold vegetables) in the Bowenpally vegetable market and nearby yards are collected from across the city. The vegetables are chopped into smaller pieces and run over the conveyor belt to the shredder. The waste then undergoes a shredding process where all the vegetables are crushed into smaller and uniform sizes and sent to a grinder. This grinder further crushes the content into pulp, which is also called slurry and passes them to the anaerobic digesters. The gas generated is collected and stored in balloons until further use. Bio Manure is obtained, apart from the gas, as a by-product. In a separate tank, biogas is collected and via a pipeline system sent for cooking. The biofuel is then supplied into a 100% biogas generator which is used to power the cold storage rooms, water pumps, shop, street lights, etc. The Biogas plant funded by the Department of Biotechnology and Department of Agriculture marketing Telangana, Geetanath (2021) was set up under the guidance and patented technology of CSIR-IICT (Council of Scientific and Industrial Research–Indian Institute of Chemical Technology) executed by the Hyderabad-based Ahuja Engineering Services Pvt Ltd. Impact\\n\\nAround 30 kg of bio-fuel generated per day is supplied to the kitchen facilities near the unit. 400- 500 units of electrical power is being utilized by the administrative building, market water supply network, around 100 streetlights, and 170 stalls of the market. This biogas unit helps reduce the electricity bill by half (previously Rs. 3 lakhs per month on average). The liquid bio manure is being used as fertilizer in the farmers’ fields. Upon realizing its efficiency, the Department of Biotechnology announced further funding to establish five more similar plants in different market yards with varying capacities (Gudimalkapur, Gaddiannaram -5 tons/day, Erragadda, Alwal, Sarrornagar- 500 kgs/ day) suitable for the generated market waste. This innovative practice of converting waste into energy at Bowenpally vegetable market has created large-scale awareness of the use of a sustainable system to generate biofuel, but also encourages more and more cities to take up similar projects for the transformation of urban landscape. *****\\nRJ\\n'),\n",

Puri\\n\\n53 Glorious years of HUDCO\\nShri Hardeep S. Puri, Minister for Housing and Urban Affairs and Petroleum and Natural Gas impressed upon designing ambitious programs in systems of lending finances with appropriate safeguards. He also highlighted HUDCO’s impending operational transition from HFC to NBFC-IFC (Infrastructure Finance Company) that would enhance the range of infrastructure project financing company can provide. As the business environment recovers and we see more financial institutions compete to lend to the state in the housing sector, it is imperative that HUDCO retains its edge. Since 1970, HUDCO has facilitated the construction of almost 2 crore residential units in India by providing financial and technical assistance and over 95% of these dwelling units have benefited the economically weaker sections and low-income groups of our society. He was speaking at the 53rd Raising Day of HUDCO here today. Shri Manoj Joshi, Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs; Shri Kuldip Narayan, Joint Secretary, Housing and Urban Affairs and Chairman and Managing Director, HUDCO; Board of Directors; and other senior officials from the Ministry and HUDCO were also present. Sh. Puri further stated that the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Urban (PMAY-U) has sought to address the shortage of housing in urban areas, particularly for low-income groups. It has become one of the largest housing programmes in the world, in terms of both scale and pace. Sh. Puri complimented Housing & Urban Development Corporation Ltd.’s (HUDCO) contribution as one of the three Central Nodal Agencies (CNA) for the CLSS component of the PMAY – U, apart from providing viability gap funding to the other three components of the mission. Shri Puri also appreciated HUDCO's excellent contribution towards nation's growth and business performance, particularly in the recent years. The Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister said that 75 years of Independence are the years of achievements for any country. He reiterated that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has placed the journey of the nation from 75 years to 100 years before the people as our Amrit Kaal.

If something related to cleanliness takes place anywhere in the country people certainly inform me about it.” ~PM Narendra Modi in Mann Ki Baat, 26th Feb., 2023\\n\\nThe 98th episode of Mann Ki Baat was focused on waste to wealth where PM highlighted the contributions of Kamala Moharana from Kendrapada district of Odisha, who runs a self-help group. He said, “The women of this group craft many things like baskets and mobile stands from milk pouches and other plastic packing materials. This is becoming a good source of income for them along with ensuring cleanliness. If we resolve, we can make a huge contribution towards a clean India. At least we all should take a pledge to replace plastic bags with cloth bags. You will see, how much satisfaction your resolution will give you, and also inspire other people.”\\n\\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's flagship address, Mann Ki Baat, first aired on October 3, 2014, will turn 100 on April 30, 2023. During these 99 episodes, PM Modi has mentioned over 700 Indians and around 300 organizations, all of whom are doing exceptional work. The radio program not just reflected the mood of the nation but brought to light citizen action for positive change. Speaking of Indore in the 80th episode, Hon’ble PM said, “We know very well that whenever the topic of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan comes up, Indore has created a special identity of its own in cleanliness. Indore has remained at number one in ‘Swachh Bharat Ranking’ for many years.” Highlighting the various initiatives from all corners of the country PM mentioned, “During the Ganpati immersion in Kakinada, people were told about the harm caused by plastic. Within three days in Odisha, more than 20 thousand school students took a pledge to inspire fellow citizens for the Swachh Sagar – Surakshit Sagar initiative.”\\n\\nSwachh Bharat Mission is very close to the Hon’ble PM’s heart and it has often found a special mention in Mann Ki Baat episodes. Whether it was the Yuva Swachhta Evam Janseva Samiti or the Youth for Parivartan, whether it was Kamala Moharana from Kendrapada or Manoj Bainjwal from Rudra Prayag, no contribution has gone unheard. Highlighting the contributions of the youth in Haryana’s Bhiwani, the PM mentioned in his Mann Ki Baat episode on 26th Feb., 2023, that a cleanliness campaign by the youth of Bhiwani, Haryana caught his attention, who decided to make his city exemplary in terms of cleanliness. They formed an organization called Yuva Swachhta Evam Janseva Samiti in order to run cleanliness drives in the city that have cleared tons of garbage from different areas of the city. Pressing upon E-Waste, PM pointed out in the 97th episode that, E-Waste if not disposed of properly, can harm the environment. But, if done carefully, it can become a great force in the Circular Economy of Recycle and Reuse. Talking about कचरे से कंचन, Hon’ble PM mentioned quite a few E-Waste recyclers. Be it E-Parisaraa of Bengaluru who developed an indigenous technology for extracting precious metals from Printed Circuit Boards or Ecoreco from Mumbai who developed a system to collect E-Waste through a Mobile App, or be it Kabadiwala, all have found mentions in PM’s popular radio show. Lauding their efforts, PM said that, “All of them are helping to make India a Global Recycling Hub.”\\n\\nPleased with the efforts and initiatives of various self-help groups, NGOs and other committees, in his 93rd episode of the show, saw PM’s narration over Youth for Parivartan from Bangalore and कबाड़ से जगुाड़ campaign by Meerut and other initiatives for protecting the environment. Applauding Jan Andolan in urban swachhata, PM mentioned in one of the episodes of Mann Ki Baat, “Swachh Bharat Mission has become firmly rooted in the mind of every Indian today. Since the inception of this mass movement in the year 2014, to take it to new heights, many unique efforts have been made by the people. In the society as well as in the villages, cities and even in the offices; this campaign is proving useful in every way.”\\nAs Mann Ki Baat turns 100 on 30th April, 2023, the invigorating stories of swachhata warriors continue to inspire and motivate all to walk एक कदम स्वचछता की ओर. *********\\nRJ\\n\"),\n",

The report delves into the reasons behind the popularity of PM’s radio broadcast and lists out the most liked characteristics that hook people to the broadcast. A powerful and decisive leadership that speaks to establish an emotional connect with the audience is cited as reason for the following of the programme.

Maharashtra Governor Shri Rameh Bais further said that India is the largest democratic country in the world and people’s participation in governance makes the country truly people-oriented. Over the years, the ‘Mann Ki Baat’ has become a medium for people to participate in governance and convey their views, suggestions and achievements to the Prime Minister of India. Shri Bais said that India has emerged as the most populous country in the world, surpassing China. To convert this demographic change into demographic dividend, Hon’ble Prime Minister has laid emphasis on skilling, reskilling and upskilling. Many countries of the world which are aging are looking towards India to meet the requirements of skilled manpower. This is India’s moment, he stated. One fact that the Prime Minister has repeatedly reiterated in the program is that the purpose of ‘Mann Ki Baat’ is to highlight positive stories and inspire citizens by telling their stories. All those people who have been mentioned anywhere in this program have really helped in making this mass movement a success. He urged more and more people of Maharashtra to be a part of this important movement.

The documentary will be anchored by popular digital media presenter Kamiya Jani. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his exclusive interaction for the documentary, has said “Our soldiers devote their entire lives and sacrificed their every being to safeguard every inch of our motherland. Their sacrifice cannot just be measured in words; its grandeur and import have to be brought alive to inspire future generations”. In line with his vision, the documentary will showcase the huge strides made by India in the last few years for the revival of India’s spirit of cultural unity and pride. Ascertaining the security as well as the sanctity for patriotic sites such as the Jallianwallah Bagh; resuscitating the splendid fervour of our civilizational centres such as Ram Janmabhoomi, Kashi Vishwanath Dham, Somnath Dham and Kedarnath Dham according respect to such spiritual sites such as Kartarpur Sahib, celebrating the lives of our freedom fighters at inspirational sites such as the Cellular Jail, centre-staging the contribution of Netaji Bose through the grand Netaji statue at India gate canopy, and honouring the legendary contribution of our patriots– past and present – through the War Memorial are some of the themes presented in\\xa0 the documentary. The clarion call given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi – “puratan, mahaan paramparaon ke prati aakarshan” or the interest in our pristine, magnanimous and unparalleled legacy –has become a nationwide phenomenon with historic participation from all sections of society. This documentary is a reflection of this very idea. While our combined pride has rejuvenated us with a sense of belongingness especially over the last few years, it is imperative for the youth of today to fully understand the significance of the sacrifices of our freedom fighters and commemorate their legacy. Equally, the sanctity of our revived and beautified spiritual centres, such as the Sabarmati Ashram, the reason behind the construction of new monuments and statues such as the Statue of Unity and the Panchteerth can be fully understood through this documentary. In essence, the two-part documentary is a visually compelling showcase of India’s vast and vibrant culture, rejuvenating, embracing, and in doing so, celebrating our rich and diverse inheritance. “धरोहर भारत की” (DHAROHAR BHARAT KI) will bring joy and pride to every Indian heart, as well as Indians-at-heart everywhere. It is only by experiencing the journey to our roots that we can follow the route to our brilliant future. ******\\nSS\\n'),\n",

In a keynote conversation session with Clare Bloomfield, Acting Chief Policy Officer of Asia Video Industry Association (AVIA) on ‘Policies to Make India a Global Content and Technical Hub’, the I & B Secretary said, “Quality of content has always been very good in India, but now it is easier for Indian content to travel across the world. OTT has helped it in a big way. Curiosity of people about India too has risen, people want to know more about India”. OTT Platforms: Relevance and Regulations\\nI & B Secretary further said that though traditional media continues to be the core and backbone of the media and entertainment industry, now the OTT platforms have also become a very important component. “But I find that many of the traditional media houses are also putting their content into their own OTT platforms. And as a customer, it is always more convenient that you're not bound by time and you'll see content at your own pace. So, I think it is a symbiotic relationship, the content creation will continue”. Speaking about OTT regulations, he informed that the Government has gone for a very soft touch regulation. “We have left it to the industry to do more of self-regulation. It is a three-tier regulation which was introduced a couple of years back. We think it is going quite well. At the first stage, if a complaint is received regarding quality of content, it is sent to the content producer to take action. At the secondary level, there is an industry body to look into it and lastly it comes to the I & B Ministry. We have received very few complaints at the Ministry level”. Stating this, the I & B Secretary also said, “But at the same time, there are concerns that this soft-touch regulations may have led to some content which is not desirable. We would request the industry to be cognizant of the concerns and culture of the country.”\\nCinematograph Act\\nThe I & B Secretary stated that the Cinematograph Act is being re-worked. “It is going to be introduced in the Parliament very soon”, he said. A provision regarding transmission of film content on internet is being added, he informed. “If that happens, it will go a big way in protecting copyright and we will be able to block those websites where pirated content are transmitted. But let’s see how it goes in the Parliament and how it proceeds”. In this connection, the I & B Secretary stated that the Government is always committed to act against piracy. “If you bring to our notice that certain websites are being used for pirated content, then we work towards blocking those websites”, he said. Ease of Doing Business – Shooting and Post-Production in India\\n“To promote Ease of Doing Business in broadcasting, we have uplinking and downlinking guidelines, where we give permissions to broadcasters and satellite channels which are broadcasting in India. We have set Broadcast Seva portal, to enable electronic processing and transparency. We have also switched from permissions to a regime of submitting information. We learn from broadcasters that they are quite happy with the new guidelines, since the process has become much easier”. I & B Secretary also informed that the Film Facilitation Office of NFDC facilitates domestic and international film-makers and it is now being aligned with state portals so that it becomes a single-window for providing both central and state government permissions and incentives. Further, incentives were announced at Cannes Film Festival for promoting film shooting in India. “We are trying to bring out a new face of Prasar Bharati very soon”\\nI & B Secretary stated that the role of Prasar Bharati is to promote socially relevant content. He referred to the ‘Swaraj’ serial which was launched during the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav last year. “I think it is a very relevant serial which showcases the history of Indian independence”, he stated and said that the Government would like content on socially relevent issues made by Prasar Bharti to reach a larger audience through the OTT platforms. That sort of collaboration can always work, he added. National Broadcasting Policy\\nThe I & B Secretary stated that a National Broadcasting Policy has been in the works because the broadcasting sector is now fragmenting into several parts with conflicting interests and the various broadcasters like media broadcasters, OTTs etc. have different mechanisms, regulations and tariffs. So there is a need for a national broadcasting policy, he added. I & B Secretary also said that terrestrial broadcasting is no longer viable and everybody has switched to satellite mode. “We decided that the frequency which was allocated to terrestrial broadcasting and was lying unused for several years, may be used for telecom purposes if required. Otherwise, whatever frequencies are allocated to broadcasting will remain with broadcasting”, he added. Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming and Comic (AVGC) : A growing sector\\nI & B Secretary reiterated that content creation potential in AVGC sector is huge. He said that AVGC Task Force report has been accepted at the Ministry level and it is being taken to the cabinet. He said that the gaming industry, whose world-wide worth is $300 billion, has a huge scope in India for growth in content creation and innovation. A lot of content is getting created in India and incentives will be given for the animation and visual effects industry and the postproduction done in India, he added. Mobile Broadcasting\\nThe I & B Secretary also said that while there are about 20 million TVs in Indian homes, the number of mobiles is almost 800 million. Hence, increasing mobile broadcasting is going to create a big push for new content creation.

In an Advisory issued today, the Ministry has taken strong exception to the recent instances of mainstream English and Hindi newspapers carrying advertisements and promotional content of betting websites. The Advisory has been issued to all media formats, including newspapers, television channels, and online news publishers, and showed specific examples where such advertisements have appeared in the media in recent times. The Ministry has also objected to the promotion by a specific betting platform encouraging the audience to watch a sports league on its website, which prima facie appears to be in violation of the Copyright Act, 1957. While emphasizing on the legal obligation as well as the moral duty of the media, the Advisory refers to provisions of the Norms of Journalistic Conduct of the Press Council which, interalia, mentions that “newspapers should not publish an advertisement containing anything which is unlawful or illegal…………”, and further that “The newspapers and periodicals should scrutinize the advertisement inputs from ethical as well as legal angles in view of the editor’s responsibility for all contents including advertisement, under Section 7 of PRB Act, 1867. Revenue generation alone cannot and should not be the sole aim of the Press, juxtaposed much larger public responsibility”. The Ministry had earlier issued Advisories in the months of June and October, 2022 stating that betting and gambling are illegal, and hence direct or surrogate advertisements of such activities falls foul of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the Press Council Act 1978, Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, and other relevant statutes.

What has been the role of Mann Ki Baat in fostering citizen engagement and promoting self-reliance? The National Conclave on Mann Ki Baat @100, organized by the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting in New Delhi today, explored this question at a thematic session titled “Jan Samvad Se Atmanirbharta”. The session was moderated by Shradha Sharma, Indian entrepreneur and Founder & CEO of YourStory Media. The session featured Sanjeev Bhikchandani, Padma Shri awardee, entrepreneur and co-founder of Info Edge which owns naukri.com; radio jockey R J Raunac; T. V. Mohandas Pai, Padma Shri Awardee and former CFO and Board Member at Infosys; Ravi Kumar Narra, Padma Shri awardee, entrepreneur and national president of Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce & Industry; and Mohd. Abbas Bhat, head of Dal Lake lotus stem producer company, applauded by the Prime Minister in the Mann Ki Baat episode of March 2023, for creating employment for many farmers by exporting food products made from lotus stem. Sharing her life story, Shradha Sharma said that she has told stories of 1.5 lakh startups and of Young India in the last 14 years, but that the moment of Atma Nirbharata came for her when Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in January 2019, gave her a one-hour interview. “The India that we are living today has one thing; since 2014, all of us have opportunity, and two, wherever we are from, we can say that we are no less than anyone else. Vocal for Local is something we all believe in. There is a sense of pride in ourselves today.”\\nT. V. Mohandas Pai said that all of us must know the India story in technology. “Prime Minister Modi stood at the Red Fort in August 2015 and said Startup India, Stand up India, Digital India. What happened since then was a miracle. We are the largest software exporter in the world. 60% of global business for software comes to India. It employs 55 lakh people. Of the ten most valuable software service companies in the world, five are Indian. Of the 32 lakh people employed in the top 10 companies, 22 lakh are Indian. We dominate this field globally. Bengaluru will export 80 billion dollars of software this year, and Bengaluru has more people working in technology than Silicon Valley.”\\nMr. Pai said that we have a startup industry which has grown since 2015, when Prime Minister gave the call for Startup India, Standup India. “We have 96,000 startups, next after only United States and China. These people employ 16 lakh people today. They created 500 billion dollars of value. By 2025, we hope to have 200 unicorns employing 36 lakh people or more, creating value of 1.5 trillion dollars. Bengaluru has the largest collection of human talent in the world for silicon chip design. This is only going to grow; we will have more people working in technology than the USA. We are really Atmanirbhar in the world of innovation, in high technology. Atma Nirbhar Bharat and Vocal for Local are happening in the technology area, both in services and startups, and it is an exciting time for Young India.”\\nReflecting on why startups are important, Sanjeev Bhikchandani said that there has been a sea change in the Indian business landscape from 1984 till now. “If I look back and see which are the industry sectors and companies which created value and jobs, many of the sectors such as internet, e-commerce, IT and ITeS, private TV channels and private airlines barely existed in 1984. A lot of what has happened has been led by new companies, i.e., very often startups. So, startups make a huge difference. It is startups more than established companies which generate growth and jobs. The giant companies of tomorrow are startups of today.”\\nMr. Bhikchandani said that while startups existed for a long time, what has happened is that it is the government under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi which has really recognized the importance of startups in India’s future and has taken proactive measures to encourage them. Speaking of Mann Ki Baat, he said it is very direct, conversational and one-on-one. “You believe the PM is talking to you. He is taking stories bottom-up, of ordinary people, those who have not been glorified in the media. The first bit of Aatma Nirbharata is self-belief. When you hear stories of regular people in the country doing incredible things and when they are talked about on Mann Ki Baat, it gives you belief that you too can do it.”\\nThe programme also covers the whole diverse range of topics, from culture, to food, to startups, he added. “It gives a national perspective; this is the magic of Mann Ki Baat.”\\nMohd. Abbas Bhat, head of Dal Lake lotus stem producer, said that the aspiration of the company is that their lotus stem reach the nook and corner of the country, and people use it. Thanking the Prime Minister for applauding the efforts of the company in his Mann Ki Baat of March 2023, he said: “I thank the Prime Minister who spoke of our Farmer Producers’ Organization; ever since he spoke of us, the demand for our lotus stem rose so much that we are now not able to meet the demand. Moreover, while we had to face lot of difficulties in getting 250 farmers to join us, since the mention by PM in Mann Ki Baat, now more than 500 farmers are willing to join us.”\\nNoting that Mann Ki Baat is the country’s most popular radio programme, R J Raunac congratulated everyone associated with the Mann Ki Baat programme for completing 100 episodes of the programme. “Wherever our radio station is there, in various regions across the country, the experience of every listener has been that the programme has inspired them very much, including to start something on their own. People have brought so many inspiring stories, and are sharing them with more and more others. I hope that Mann Ki Baat registers double century and beyond.”\\nRavi Kumar Narra said that there has been a clear shift in the way government approaches the welfare of SC and ST communities. “Before 2014 and after 2014, there has been a clear difference in the development of Dailt community. From 2014, a SC member gets Rs. 15 crore loan without any collateral security. Stand up India is the biggest financial inclusion programme, which provides Rs. 1 crore loan without any collateral security in any bank branch. This is very successful, leading to creation of entrepreneurs in villages as well. Another achievement is the SC ST Hub, which is leading to skill development, mentorship and provision of interest subvention, investment subsidy.”\\nMr. Narra said that earlier, the thinking of government and of the people did not use to match. “With Mann Ki Baat, the people and the government are thinking alike, and the policies are reaching field level. When someone in a bank says that there is no such scheme or asks for security, people are showing the recording of Mann Ki Baat programme and asserting their rights. Thus, the programme has been instrumental in including all people, in facilitating understanding of government policies and their execution.”\\nWhat makes Mann Ki Baat unique? This is what the panelists had to say. Mohandas Pai: “Government has come close, the Prime Minister gives us hope, confidence and inspiration and new information, he showcases the culture of this great country, he shows ordinary heroes whom he respects. At Padma Shri awards, when I saw a tribal woman from Karnataka walk barefoot and receive the award from the President, I felt so proud of this country. Mann Ki Baat is a manifestation of that sentiment where every individual can aspire to reach the highest position and the country recognizes them and gives them equal opportunity.”\\nSanjeev Bhikchandani: “Each individual programme is a few stories, but when you add up, it is a mosaic of the story of India, and the Prime Minister tells it so well.”\\nR J Raunac: “It is a matter of great pride that India’s most -listened programme is a radio programme, the Prime Minister has chosen such a medium which can reach almost every person. When you listen to him, you do not feel that he is speaking to 140 crore people or to a group, you feel that he is speaking to you.”\\nMohd. Abbas Bhat: “Mann Ki Baat is such a platform where people from humble backgrounds too get an opportunity to rise up to high levels.”\\nRavi Kumar Narra: “The Prime Minister has captured the pulse of the people and Mann Ki Baat is a programme which unites everyone, not only culturally and religiously but administratively as well. This is going to give a very positive result in the development of our country.”\\nThe session also featured a short Q&A session.

JoshiPM Chose Radio As A Medium Which Is Available With All Rich And Poor Alike And This Has Had An Equalising Impact On The Society: Prof. Najma Akhtar\\nA day long National Conclave on Mann Ki Baat was organised today at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi to mark the continued success of Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi’s monthly radio broadcast ‘Mann Ki Baat’ that has reached over 100 crore people across India. The conclave was inaugurated by Vice President of India, Shri Jagdeep Dhankar in the presence of Guest of Honour, Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Shri Anurag Thakur. Over 100 esteemed citizens from various parts of the country who have been mentioned by the Prime Minister in various episodes of “Mann Ki Baat” also attended the event. Four panel discussion sessions highlighting the wide-ranging themes of “Nari Shakti”, “Virasat Ka Uthan”, “Jan Samvad Se Atmanirbharta” and “Ahwan Se Jan Andolan”. The fourth session was on the theme ‘Awahan Se Jan Andolan’ where in the panellists discussed how ‘Mann ki Baat’ has become a platform from where several important campaigns and people’s movements have originated. Right from the very first ‘Mann ki Baat’, when the Prime Minister had given the clarion call of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the addresses have time and again inspired the people to take action on important issues. To discuss these campaigns, the session was moderated by RJ Sharad and the esteemed panellists included Mr. Aamir Khan, actor, Dr. Shashank R. Joshi, endocrinologist and diabetologist, Ms. Deepmala Pandey, school principal, Ms. Karishma Mehta, writer and photographer and Prof. Najma Akhtar, educationist and administrator. Ms. Deepmala Pandey’s ‘One teacher, one call’ initiative for children with special needs was appreciated by Prime Minister in Mann Ki Baat in September, 2021. Radio Jockey Mr. Sharad at the very onset said that PM’s ‘Mann Ki Baat’ is a positive magnet that has attracted millions of people and touched their hearts and started many campaigns. He said that similarly the esteemed panellists have a magnet of positivity in them with a willingness and power to do something positive. Talking to Actor Aamir Khan about how he supports social causes such as single use plastic ban, Har Ghar Tiranga Campaign, through his body of works, the moderator asked Mr. Aamir Khan what attracts him the most towards the platform ‘Mann Ki Baat’ (MKB). Mr. Aamir Khan said the programme and concept of MKB is the biggest example of transformational change and people’s movement. He said as the leader of such a large country, it is imperative for PM to talk to the people and let every know what is in his mind and guide the masses. He said the reason for the success of MKB is that PM made an effort to connect with the masses which is very important as it takes people into confidence and gives them the vision and direction and becomes the start of a people’s movement. Mr. Khan further said that it is only because PM wants to connect with the masses, he has invested in it and there is an emotion behind it which comes through and that is why people believe and trust Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. This trust has been built over time and trust has to be earned and clearly the PM has earned it. Dr.'),\n",

Joshi, endocrinologist and diabetologist called Prime Minister Modi a father figure and said PM feels the pain of the people. When the COVID pandemic affected us all, PM expressed full confidence on Indian Doctors and scientists which is very significant and PM, based on this confidence, made a roadmap and has led India to become Aatmanirbhar and empowered India through his effective leadership and helped ally the fear in the minds of the masses through MKB & gave confidence to all. Dr. Shashank further said that each and every life was considered important by the PM and he wanted to save all lives and reduce their pain which became a motivator for all doctors and scientists to do better. Now covid is gone but India made its own vaccine and vaccinated all its citizens. Through MKB, PM made masses aware and like a father figure he understood everyone’s problems and allayed fear and also gave motivation to all to excel and become number one in the world. He said PM does not compromise on anything especially excellence. PM could get done what the world could not, and the credit for it goes to the leader of the nation. Prof. Najma Akhtar, Vice Chancellor of Jamia Millia Islamia University said the 100th episode is coming and MKB has become a mass movement because of the vision of PM Modi. PM chose Radio as a medium which is available with all rich and poor alike and this has had an equalising impact on the society. Talking about the research being undertaken at the university regarding MKB, she said people have been motivated through the radio programme in their own unique ways and this exceptional way of communication is being celebrated as a festival. She also talked about the upcoming symposium being organised in the university on MKB and various other initiatives. Mr. Aamir khan said “communication is a fundamental requirement for any leader and the ability to speak with the masses, about women issues, economics and other issues that affect the people is a very important quality and PM has this exceptional quality to express these things to a common man and connect with them and these are extremely important qualities of a great leader. PM does not need to campaign as he has such a massive reach that he simple has to directly communicate, and takes everyone along.”\\nMs. Deepmala Pandey, school principal, from the one teacher, one call initiative said they created a network of teachers using digital platforms on social media to connect teachers, parents and students. She said when PM talked about it in MKB, the movement got massive support from not just India but various other countries. She said this movement should move towards one citizen one call. The Governor of Telangana, Ms. Tamilisai Soundararajan joining through VC said that PM never said MKB is an expression of his mind but it is the expression of expectations of the people and people are giving suggestions throughout the month which encourages the PM to talk more to the people of the country. She said PM reaches out to people through the bottom of his heart and his words become a people’s movement. As an example, she said PM’s message on stopping food wastage got lakhs to messages from masses on how they are utilising food optimally and ensuring food wastage is reduced. Another example is selfie with daughters which gave self confidence to the daughters. Talking about success of Swachh Bharat Mission, Ms. Tamilisai Soundararajan said when PM appealed for Cleanliness movement, 75 lakh students participated in the movement, 40 thousand organisations participated, 2.5 crore children participated in the drawing competition on Swachh Bharat. Giving statistics, she also asserted that promotion of Khadi, Vande Bharat, Sukanya Samridhi scheme, Organ Transplantation, Har Ghar Tiranga, are similar examples of successful mass campaigns and whatever subject is taken up by the Hon’ble PM, it becomes a people’s movement as PM expresses the voice of the people. She also narrated a small poem on MKB in Tamil. Ms. Karishma Mehta, writer and photographer said the Prime Minister of the country has gone through a struggle and this motivates others. She said story telling is very powerful, when she talks about taboo topics such as single parent, people often say this is their story. She says MKB is also about story telling and it resonates with the masses. Mr. Aamir Khan said that a real story has a deeper impact and MKB is about people’s lives and it has a deep impact on the masses. He said “when I hear a story from the writer, if that story touches my heart and engages me and attracts me like a magnet, I feel I should be a part of it.” Similarly, MKB has stories that attract people and listeners get inspired hearing others stories which is important for everyone. Mr. Khan said MKB has so many advantages on many layers. He further said that I experienced something similar during the ‘Satyamev Jayate’ Show. In conclusion, the moderator asked all the panellists to give a message to the listeners of MKB. Dr. Shashank R. Joshi gave the message of a ‘Swasth Bharat’ or Healthy India and asked all to incorporate the discipline in their lifestyle just like Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi. Prof. Najma Akhtar said that MKB is a package of education and entertainment and it lit up the life of all those it touched. She further added that Jamia students are playing the 100 episodes again to reach all those students who have not heard it till now. Ms. Deepmala Pandey said we need to progress further together through cooperation and should be sensitive towards others needs. Ms. Karishma Mehta said that if you have an opportunity to help someone then you should do it as no help is too small and no kindness is too less. Mr. Aamir Khan gave love to all the listeners of MKB and said we are all part of a beautiful country on a unique journey and we are all connected. ******\\nAS\\n'),\n",

The conclave was inaugurated by Vice President of India, Shri Jagdeep Dhankar in the presence of Guest of Honour, Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Shri Anurag Thakur. Over 100 esteemed citizens from various parts of the country who have been mentioned by the Prime Minster in various episodes of “Mann Ki Baat” also attended the event. Four panel discussion sessions highlighting the wide-ranging themes of “Nari Shakti”, “Virasat Ka Uthan”, “Jan Samvad Se Atmanirbharta” and “Ahwan Se Jan Andolan”. The inaugural session was followed by the first and possibly the most significant session on Nari Shakti, a topic which has transcended almost all episodes on ‘Mann Ki Baat’ and is close to the heart of the Prime Minister. The sessions highlighted the transformative impact that Mann Ki Baat has had across the nation in effectively empowering women and bringing them to the forefront of nation building. The Prime Minister has laid emphasis on women-led development as a central dimension of India’s progress and a necessity for strengthening India. In the past nine years, numerous welfare schemes have been launched paving the way to empowering women and making them lead India’s development journey. The discussion was moderated by renowned anchor and host, Ms. Richa Anirudh and the audiences were mesmerised by the eminent panellists such as Ms. Kiran Bedi, IPS (retired) and former Lt. Governor, Puducherry, Ms. Deepa Malik, athlete, Ms. Raveena Tandon, actress, Mr. Dhimant Parekh, Founder and CEO, The Better India, RJ Nitin, Ms. Nikhat Zareen, boxer and Ms. Poorna Malavath, mountaineer. Ms. Malavath, who is the world’s youngest girl to climb Mount Everest in 2014, completed the seven-summit mountaineering challenge in 2022 and was praised by Prime Minister in Mann Ki Baat in June, 2022. Ms. Kiran Bedi, in her opening remarks said if we want this country to see a change, we need to change the mindset of parents and elders because it is this mindset that gets passed on to the children and others in the family. She said that the concept of ‘Paraya Dhan’ needs to be changed as it makes women insecure and we need to give women financial independence and make them self-reliant only then will women feel strong. Ms. Bedi added that parents need to convey the message of equality among children and inculcate similar education and skills. Girls need to feel that they are also responsible towards running the household and taking care of their parents. In conclusion, Ms. Bedi emphasised on three things for women empowerment namely financial independence, education & skills and physically and mentally healthy women for which women need to play sports. Talking about the significance of radio as a forum for change, RJ Nitin said that he strongly believes in radio as an effective medium and has been working in it for 23 years. He added that it is a responsibility of men to ensure women are empowered and if you truly love your mother and sister, then you will work for women empowerment and also ensure that all women are strong enough to find their own opportunities. He said that Radio is a good medium to spread the message far and wide and that is why Prime Minister also chose this medium as this medium has the maximum strength. In closing, he said he is glad to be a part of this and he will ensure that he will make all efforts for women empowerment. Ms. Raveena Tandon talking about arts as a medium of expression and having done movies with strong women characters and women empowering themes said lots of change has come in the industry which was not there in the 90s and earlier decades. She said that time there was a struggle for actors to increase awareness about social causes as it was considered not box office friendly or depressing movies which the audiences’ wont like. Ms. Tandon said that she tried to do as many movies with a positive social message as possible, daman was one such movie which done in 2000 and 23 years later also marital rape is still an issue and that movie got a national award and rightfully so, as it was ahead of its time and we are still discussing these issues. She added that the correction in society has happened. Women are more assimilated in the industry in all kinds of jobs and they have more opportunities as she has sensitivity and understanding of issues. Today in the industry women are paid more than their male counterparts and they rule the TV industry. Even on OTT platforms women rule. The film industry is slowly but surely moving in this direction. She asserted that women have broken the glass ceiling. In the entire world, India has the maximum number of female pilots. In conclusion she said India is still called a developing country but she does not understand why as women in India have gone ahead by leaps and bounds and left the world behind as far as progress in concerned. Taking about radio as a powerful medium and Prime Minister talking about women empowerment in almost all episodes, Ms. Raveena Tandon said “firstly I want to congratulate Prasar Bharti and Modi ji for successfully completing the 100 episodes of Mann Ki Baat”. She said the mass outreach of radio and being a very powerful medium for change, and the way PM talks makes everyone feels like it is their own story. She said that the Prime Minister’s idea of Mann Ki Baat to reach all villages and households especially how PM lauds the true heroes from the grassroots through radio is a genius idea and has been highly successful in touching the heart of each and every Indian. Talking about the selfie with daughters, AWAS yojana and other key schemes, Mr. Dhimant Parekh said, at better India we publish so many positive and inspiring stories and all are led by women and the entire team is women led. He asserted that to bring change we need two things, inspiration and awareness and Mann Ki Baat has brought these two things beautifully together. Mann Ki Baat has inspired us and made us aware about what we can do. Talking about Open Defecation & sanitation, he said that PM spoke about a women who got married and realised that there were no toilets in the entire village where she got, she got all women to come together and petitioned and got 75 toilets constructed in her village and she did not stop there she went back to her maternal village and got more toilets constructed there so she improved two villages and that is true women empowerment and Nari Shakti which shows how inspiration is so important and that is what Mann Ki Baat has been doing so successfully. Ms. Nikhat Zareen, talking about her meeting with the Prime Minister said that when she won gold in the world championship and got invited by PM Modi, she had only seen him through TV or social media but when she met him, the Hon’ble PM was so casual and calm that she did not feel as if she is talking to the PM but it felt as if she is talking to some elder from her own family. She said that “My father was the support behind my boxing, and PM fulfilled my wish for a selfie and I met him again after commonwealth championship and gifted him boxing gloves as a token of appreciation, meeting the Prime Minister was a good experience and inspiration as she comes from a village and it was a great motivator.”\\nElaborating on how Prime minister not just supports the winners but also motivates and inspires the sportspersons who lose, Ms. Zareen said “when I got injured, I was out of boxing for one year and people started saying I will not be able to make a comeback and my career was over but my family supported me and I made the comeback.” She added “Uggtey hue suraj ko sab salaam kartey hai but our hon’ble Prime Minister motivates and inspires us at all times, winning or losing is not important and PM keeps motivating inspiring and asking us to keep playing. This is a big quality in the Prime Minister.”\\n\\nMs. Poorna Malavath, who climbed Mount Everest at an age of 13 years said “I never expected I will be able to climb the highest mountain in the world and then meeting the Prime Minister of India was also completely unexpected. I came from a small town and it was a great moment of my life to meet Prime Minister for almost an hour and he spoke to me in such a friendly manner like a family member and was highly motivating and I got great support from him.” She added “I want to thank Modiji for making such a big impact to my life. I am a tribal girl from a poor background, my parents are farmers and opportunities are less but now people know me because I met the Prime Minister and there has been a huge change in my life.” Ms. Malavath asserted that now she is encouraging more girls and made a profession out of her passion and now she is training and encouraging youngsters and expanding this adventure throughout India. Ms. Deepa Malik is an inspiration for all in India, and is the first female para-athlete to win an Olympic medal in 2016. Highlighting the importance of the change in the mindset of the masses simply by using the word ‘divyang’ instead of ‘Viklang’ which was propagated by the Prime Minister in Mann Ki Baat, She said “It was my pleasure to meet Prime Minister Modi at ‘Chai Pe Charcha’ and PM remembered each and every word of our discussion and heard our Mann Ki baat and said let us focus on abilities over disabilities.” PM through Mann Ki Baat urged all to use the word ‘divyangs’. She asserted that “when PM says something the entire country listens and he makes a deep change in the entire country.” Ms. Malik played out a one minute clip of the Prime Minister’s Mann Ki Baat wherein PM said that she has defeated her disabled by winning the medal and this is so powerful, it shows their willpower and talent. Ms. Malik stated that women empowerment has been promoted a lot through MKB and especially for divyangs. Ms. Nikhat Zareen highlighted that Khelo India has made a big change to sports in India as financial support is very important and Khelo India has provided this support to all athletes and especially women athletes who have progressed in sports and made records. She said “Women also inspire others to work harder and play harder.” Talking about the TOP (Target Olympic Podium) scheme, she said “it is very important for all athletes and the support we get though it inspires us to work harder and get more medals for the nation.”\\nMs. Raveena Tandon also talked about being a part of Women20 under the umbrella G20 and said her experience has been excellent and the brainstorming and agenda setting for policy making has been an enriching experience. She added “Women at the grassroot level need to be given an impetus through financial empowerment. This is a country where Nari Shakti was prayed to like a goddess like Chandi, Kali Durga and now we have pilots, bankers, technocrats, sports women, and these are our Nari Shakti.”. She also said “Environment and global warming is close to my heart and women lead the way towards recycling and sustainability and women are the ones that take the society forward and they should spread this light as much as possible as they are very powerful in any role they play”. ******\\nAS\\n'),\n",

The event saw the culmination of a day-long programme of discussions over the impact of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s monthly radio broadcast on the nation. Addressing the audience during the session Union Minster Shri Amit Shah said that Mann Ki Baat is a unique experiment that has strengthened the foundation of our democracy. It has also established a connect between the youth and Akashwani. Dialogue between citizens and the government is one of the key measures of democracy and the strength of a democracy is determined by the robustness and effectiveness of this dialogue. The 99 episodes of this dialogue in Mann Ki Baat have provided a platform to the creative prowess and moral fiber of the country. Recounting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s major contribution to Indian governance he said that firstly the Prime Minister has brought about the removal of casteism, nepotism and appeasement politics from Indian democratic system, the very things that corrupted the expression of general franchise. Now Indian politics has moved to a system of political performance where those who perform deserve to serve people, he added. Another significant contribution, the Minister went on, was the democratization of Padma awards, which were long held hostage to a system of recommendations. Now any common citizen who has significantly contributed to the country and is deserving of the award can get it, he stated. Mann Ki Baat has provided a huge platform to people conducting small societal experiments, in their own small capacity to provide guidance to the society. The Minister said that while similar conversations by other famous world leaders have carried a political colour, Mann Ki Baat has been devoid of even the slightest political hue. Shri Amit Shah said that Mann Ki Baat has created a pan India presence and has covered varied topics addressing various groups of people, in turn creating a huge impact on the conscience of the country. It has contributed to the success of multiple programmes of public awareness and societal change like clean India, fit India, Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, water conservation, vocal for local, aatmanirbhar Bharat and sugamya bharat. Mann Ki Baat has been a communication tool that has brought about an honest discussion about the challenges before the country, turned people into key stakeholders in the solution to these challenges and nudged them towards the solutions on the ground. The communication methodology employed by Prime Minister Modi is erected on four pillars insofar as it is emotional, it is spiritual, it is intellectual and it stimulates physical action. The Minster termed this as a PERFECT communication (P-Peace, E-Empowerment, R-Reflective, F-Festive, E-Economic Development, C-Caring, T-Thoughtful)\\nThe Minister noted that Mann Ki Baat has played a key role in popularizing Khadi, in turn contributing to the revival of rural economy. The impact of Mann Ki Baat can be gauged from the fact that since his mention of making toys domestically and supporting the toy industry, the import of toys dramatically fell by 70% from $371 million in 2018-19 to $110 million in 2021-22 and the exports grew to $326 million from $202 million\\nHe concluded by saying Mann Ki Baat is a platform to cultivate the hidden powers of the society, it is a platform to acknowledge the earnest efforts of people, it is a mechanism to motivate the people of the nation towards working for a multidimensional progress of the country. Union Minister Shri Ashwini Vaishnav in his address said that the change in political scenario in 2014 brought about an alignment between the people and the government, what had earlier been a space of friction.'),\n",

These artists have been lauded by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in his various Mann ki Baat addresses for reviving traditional art forms. The Vice President was gifted with a unique Kaavi Painting made by artist Shri Sagar Mule from Goa. Shri Sagar Mule is re-inventing Kaavi paintings of the Konkan region with a modern touch. The bright red found in Goa’s laterite soil is expertly infused with mixed media to bring to life diverse themes, ranging from traditional temple designs and festivals to life in the village. Sagar’s efforts have revived the centuries-old art form, bringing wide interest and attention to its conservation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi appreciated Sagar’s efforts through Mann ki Baat in December 2016. Other dignitaries and panellists were gifted with Pattachithra paintings on stone made by Bhagyashree Sahu from Odisha and Etikoppaka Wooden Toys made by C V Raju from Andhra Pradesh. Bhagyashree Sahu, through her deft brush strokes pays obeisance to Lord Jagannath and keeps alive the oldest artform to emerge from eastern India, Pattachitra. While traditional Pattachitra is done on natural cloth scrolls, Bhagyashree has chosen stones of varying sizes and shapes as her muse. Etikoppaka Wooden Toys, the GI tagged handicraft of Andhra Pradesh has its origins dating back to the Rajas of Vizianagaram. Made out of wood and coloured with natural dyes, these toys are finally coated with lac, a colourless resinous secretion of numerous insects. CV Raju has successfully revived the age-old tradition of Etikoppaka wooden toy craft and has managed to make the craft community quality conscious through his efforts.

The Conclave has been organised to mark the continued success of Prime Minister’s monthly radio broadcast that has reached over 100 crore people across India. Speaking on the occasion Vice President Shri Dhankar called 2014 an epochal development that has shaped the destiny of India taking her on a path of progress and an unstoppable rise. Calling a coalition government a brake on development, Shri Dhankar qualified his observation stating “in 2014, after a gap of 30 years, India received political stability in Parliament in form of a single party majority government”. He further noted that in 2014 Prime Minister started his experiment in personal communication with the people in form of Mann Ki Baat. The experiment had another consequence, bringing the hitherto straggling medium of communication, the radio, to the forefront. The Vice President praised the monthly broadcast for being completely apolitical and commended the achievement of 100 episodes. He called Mann Ki Baat a reflection of our civilizational ethos. Speaking about the sessions that followed the inaugural event, he said that now is the best time for Nari Shakti, and women are entering unchartered arenas of achievements, exemplifying with the fact that our President is an enormously talented tribal woman. A culturally rich country had forgotten its own contribution and the Prime Minister’s contribution through his Mann Ki Baat in reviving that spirit is notable, he further stated. Shri Dhankar spoke about India when it completes 100 years of independence in 2047 and said the firm foundations of Bharat@100 and what the country would be, have been strongly laid by MannKiBaat@100. He also credited the programme with causing a general reduction in negativity in the country and increase in all-round positive sentimentality. He added that while earlier the country was losing hope and our worldwide image had nosedived, now we foresee India at the top. “Mann Ki Baat has branded local artisans, talent and skills in a very short span of time. It is a bouquet of diversity in a country divided by caste, creed and religion unable to harness the talent. It is a harbinger of mass movement as exemplified during Janta Curfew, which was only a call to action by the Prime Minister. The programme capsules the aspirations of our people, motivates them to look forward”, Shri Dhankar said. Union Minister Shri Anurag Thakur during his speech said that Mann Ki Baat is woven around the theme of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat. The programme plays a key role in highlighting the achievements of common people of India and the medium chosen for this messaging the Radio is the original medium of mass communication. The Minister acknowledged the presence of 106 dignitaries who have been mentioned during various editions of Mann Ki Baat and further said that achievements of over 700 people and organisations have found mention in the 99 episodes aired so far. While Government has launched Khelo India to encourage athletes, Mann Ki Baat has acted as force multiplier for their motivation by taking their achievements to every household in the country. Mann Ki Baat has become a mechanism to influence behaviour, as has been brought out by a recent survey by IIM Rohtak. Citing an instance, the Minister recalled when Prime Minister lauded a couple who donated their infant daughters’ organs after her demise, the message of organ donation was warmly received in every family. Shri Thakur informed the audience that when the Prime Minister visits foreign countries, he carries with him gifts from the smallest regions of the country and presents them to the dignitaries from the host country, thus giving identities and symbols from corners of India worldwide recognition. That many surveys across the world keep finding PM Modi as a leading favourite among world leaders is a testimony to the effective reach of Mann Ki Baat, he added. Citing recent visit by Apple CEO Tim Cook to India, the Minister said today the world looks up to India and its economy as a beacon of hope amid global despondency. The Prime Minister seeks inputs for his radio broadcast from the people of India. The Minister informed that 61 thousand inputs were received only for the first 15 episodes of Mann Ki Baat. 2017 witnessed the expansion of the reach of the programme by way of translation of the Prime Minister’s address in various languages. Secretary, Ministry of I&B Shri Apurva Chandra in his welcome note, said that the 106 achievers present in the audience are a reflection of the Prime Minister’s vision of community participation leading to social change. He credited Mann Ki Baat with having a tremendous social impact by inspiring and empowering people. He remarked that Mann Ki Baat has become the most popular programme in the history of All India Radio. Also present on the occasion were Dr Sudesh Dhankar, wife of Vice President Shri Jagdeep Dhankar and Shri Gaurav Dwivedi, CEO, Prasar Bharati. The inaugural event marked the release of two books by the Vice President. The first, a coffee table book on ‘Mann Ki Baat@100’, highlights the journey of 'Mann Ki Baat' and how the programme has resulted in the beginning of a new epoch in direct communication between the Prime Minister and the citizens. The second book, 'Collective Spirit, Concrete Action' by Shri, S. S. Vempati, former CEO of Prasar Bharati, documents the fascinating facets of PM Modi's ongoing conversations with the world's largest democracy, highlighting social, economic, environmental, cultural, health, and fitness issues that resonate with the very heart of our nation. The day long conclave consists of four thematic sessions on the topic Nari Shakti, Virasat Ka Uthan, Jan Samvad Se Atmanirbharta and Ahwan Se Jan Andolan followed by a valedictory session. 100th episode of the monthly radio broadcast Mann Ki Baat will be aired on 30th April 2023. ******\\n\\nSaurabh Singh\\n\"),\n",

An eminent panel participating in the 2nd Session on ‘Viraasat ka Utthan’ (Regeneration of Heritage) during the day-long National Conference on “Mann Ki Baat @100” in New Delhi today, said PM Modi’s initiative does recognize people at the grassroots level. Initiating the discussion, radio show host and storyteller Neelesh Misra set the tone, narrating his journey into tribal heartland, accompanied by his children, his encounters with people rooted in their forest lands and their discovery of how the tribal people have been living with heritage in their day-to-day life. “‘Mann Ki Baat’ is an extraordinary initiative that takes us back to our roots,” said Misra, India's most loved story teller and host of Big FM's “Yaadon Ka Idiot Box” show. Environmentalist Rochamliana, General Secretary of Save Chite Lui Movement, spoke about his campaign to revive the Chite Lui river in Mizoram that runs through state capital Aizawl. Urging for a holistic view of our river bodies, he said PM Modi highlighted the success of his campaign in the 90th episode of Mann Ki Baat in June, 2022. “Prime Minister’s words will inspire the people to preserve our river systems and save them from environmental degradation,” he said. Jagat Kinkhabwala, environment conservationist who runs ‘Save the Sparrow’ campaign, said while we cannot ignore development, we have to carry both the economy and the environment together. “When PM Modi touched upon Save the Sparrow campaign in 2017, awareness grew about our programme and even environmental activists from the US and other countries became involved,” he said. Stating that sparrows reside near human habitations, the Sparrowman, as he is popularly known, noted that human beings is the only species working for “profit”. “We are not owners of this Earth,” he said. Ricky Kej, a three-times Grammy Award-winning music composer and environmentalist, said PM Modi spoke about tribal musicians who have been honoured with the Padma awards, in ‘Mann Ki Baat’ episode in January this year, and in the next episode, PM Modi mentioned about artists like Sursingar player Joydeep Mukherjee and Mandolin exponent Uppalapu Srinivas, who, the PM said, “have breathed new life into these instruments.” “With ‘Mann Ki Baat’, Prime Minister mainstreamed folk music forms born in India,” he said.

Both the Ministers showed optimism towards the results presented under the interventions in the industrial pollution abatement project through multi-stakeholder platform for textile cluster in Panipat, Haryana. Welcoming the delegations, Shri G. Asok Kumar gave a brief overview and journey of the India-Netherlands cooperation in the water sector and called the 1st Ministerial-level meeting of the Joint Working Group the “culmination” of the efforts started with the visit of Dutch Prime Minister Mr. Mark Rutte to India in 2015 followed by the visit of the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India Shri Narendra Modi to the Netherlands in June 2017 to mark the 70th anniversary of the diplomatic relationship between India and the Netherlands. “The visit provided a significant boost to the bilateral ties and a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the Ministry of Water Resources, India & Ministry of Infrastructure & Environment of Netherlands in June 2017 to strengthen the collaboration between the two countries in the field of water, delta management and water technology. Joint Secretary (EW), Ministry of External Affairs, Mr. Sandeep Chakravorty while making intervention desired that the activities under the framework may also be carried to other geographical areas including Bangladesh, Nepal, Indonesia and Africa. The work plan of the Joint Working Group includes three Action Plans on bilateral water cooperation with: 1. Ministry of Jal Shakti in particular National Mission for Clean Ganga, Ministry of Irrigation, Kerala and Ministry of Irrigation and Waterways, West Bengal. Action Plan Jal Shakti/NMCG – The Netherlands consists of five program areas including Sustainable water quality management, Urban water management, Monitoring and decision making, Living with and valuing of water, Resilient water systems and Sustainable Water Quality Management. This program area will support the efforts of NMCG and other governmental organizations in India to improve the water quality of the water systems. It will cover water quality issues in a river basin, e.g. Ganga basin, and might also cover knowledge needs of state governments and other institutions involved in water quality management. Urban water management will bring together the on-going activities of the River Cities Alliance (RCA) in India and the Water as Leverage (WaL) program initiated by the Netherlands. The core objective of RCA is to provide the member cities with a platform to discuss and exchange information on aspects that are vital for sustainable management of urban rivers. Under the Monitoring and Decision making program, efforts will be made to make proper use of the data, collected at different levels, available in India. Some of this data is made public, other data is classified or kept for internal use only. The challenge is use this hydrological data for decision making, investments or operational purposes. Living with and valuing water component relates to the Aviral Ganga (Unrestricted Flow) and Arth Ganga (economy and livelihood) components of Namami Ganga. Aviral Ganga and Arth Ganga in India are based on the same principles as several concepts in the Netherlands such as Living with Water and Building with Nature. Resilient water systems is oriented at achieving water security at local and basin level and making the water systems resilient to cope with variable conditions. Action Plan Kerala – The Netherlands will focus on knowledge exchange and capacity building. Related to river basement management knowledge exchange will be on Integrated Water Resource Management. 1. Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) - Materialize IWRM concept in Kerala; - Address the challenges in integrated river basin management; - Mitigation of urban flooding and sharing institutional mechanisms; - Utilize Nature Based Solutions, such as ‘Room for the River’ and ‘Living with Water’. Action West Bengal – The Netherlands action plan is divided in two periods: 1. Exploratory phase (2022 – 2023) of Capacity building to be conversant with dike design and construction as per state-of-the-art international good practices, an outline for holistic master plan, including a strategy towards a healthy river basin; basic understanding of coastal zone management. The aim of the Strategic Water Partnership is to further intensify and expand on-going bilateral cooperation through involving policy experts, academia, knowledge institutes, private companies and communities/stakeholders and combining resources, expertise, knowledge skills. The Partnership adds strategic direction to the cooperation in order to maximize the benefits for both countries. The character of the Strategic Water Partnership is knowledge cooperation in which each partner will finance its own expenses arising from the cooperation. Knowledge exchange will mainly take place by interaction between Indian and Netherlands experts and officials. The Netherlands delegation included Mr. Luit-Jan Dijkhuis, Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management, Ms. Jet van Paassen, Social Media Advisor, Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management, Mr. Thorsten Wege, Senior Policy Coordinator, International Affairs, Ms. Odilia Knap, Deputy Director, International Affairs, Mr. Joost Geijer, Head of Economic Affairs at the Netherlands Embassy and Ms. Nishi Chandra Pant, Senior Policy Officer, Netherlands Embassy.

Out of these, 50 projects have been reported to be completed so far. Further, 23 of the remaining projects have physical progress more than 90%, while another 14 projects have physical progress between 80% to 90%. Against a target of 34.64 lakh hectare of additional irrigation, during 2016-2022 an additional irrigation potential of 24.35 lakh hectare has been created through these projects. Further, inclusion of projects other than the 99 prioritized projects has been permitted for implementation of PMKSY-AIBP during 2021-2026. In view of the same, six additional projects have been included under PMKSY-AIBP, in which an additional irrigation potential of 0.12 lakh hectare has been created during 2021-22. As seen from the above, PMKSY-AIBP continues to perform satisfactorily in providing assistance to the States to complete the advanced stage irrigation projects held up due to financial constraints, to provide irrigation benefits to the farmers. PMKSY was launched during the year 2015-16, with an aim to enhance physical access of water on farm and expand cultivable area under assured irrigation, improve on-farm water use efficiency, introduce sustainable water conservation practices, etc. With the inclusion of AIBP under PMKSY in 2016, a paradigm shift was made in implementation of the programme. During 2016-17, 99 ongoing major/medium irrigation projects were prioritized in consultation with States and included under PMKSY-AIBP, for completion in mission mode, along with their Command Area Development & Water Management (CADWM) works. Funding mechanism through NABARD was approved by the Government for both Central and State share. Thus, the strategy was devised for completion of the identified priority irrigation projects, which the States chose to be completed in mission mode, with assured funding through NABARD. Further, based on the experience gained during 2016-2021, the strategy for implementation of PMKSY-AIBP during the period 2021-2026 has been further partially modified, by adding other projects through a liberalised inclusion criteria, and funding through budgetary resources. Development Monitoring and Evaluation Office (DMEO) under NITI Ayog has carried out evaluation of PMKSY for the period 2015-2020. AIBP has been graded as the ‘satisfactory’ (highest category) in parameters such as relevance, efficiency, impact and equity. Further, grading for effectiveness has been determined as ‘average’ (second best category), while sustainability of the programme has been graded as ‘needs improvement’. Government of India reviews its schemes, including PMKSY-AIBP, from time to time, and the requisite changes are brought about to make the implementation more effective. Further, the State Governments are mandated to monitor implementation of irrigation projects under PMKSY-AIBP and ensure their proper operation and maintenance. In addition, such projects are regularly monitored by Central Water Commission, as well as by a dedicated Project Management Unit (PMU) under the Ministry of Jal Shakti. Physical and financial progress of these projects is also monitored through a dedicated dashboard, backed with a management information system maintained by this Ministry. This information was given by the Minister of State for Jal Shakti, Shri Bishweswar Tudu in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today. *****\\nAS\\n'),\n",

Rivers pickup, carry and drop silt load as per their regime conditions i.e. discharge in the river, river slope, morphology, nature of silt etc. However, the accumulation of silt in reservoirs / water bodies leads to reduction of their water storage capacity. Therefore, periodic surveys to assess their current capacity are primarily undertaken by the owners of water bodies and dam owners who are generally State Governments. Central Water Commission (CWC) has conducted sediment survey of 58 selected reservoirs using hydro-graphic technique and 179 studies of different reservoirs have been conducted through remote sensing technique. The outcome of these studies have been shared with the concerned State Government / dam owners. De-siltation of water bodies and dams is primarily the responsibility of owners of water bodies and dam owners. In order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, the Department of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation (DoWR, RD & GR) provides technical and financial assistance to encourage sustainable development and efficient management of water resources through various schemes and programmes such as Repair, Renovation and Restoration (RRR) of water bodies and Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP). The RRR of water bodies scheme has multiple objectives like expanding cultivable area under assured irrigation by improvement and restoration of water bodies thereby increasing the tank storage capacity and revival of lost irrigation potential, improving water use efficiency, introduction of sustainable water conservation practices, ground water recharge, increased availability of drinking water, improvement of catchment areas of tank commands etc. Under the scheme, the Government has provided an amount of Rs 450.79 crore as central assistance to various States since the year 2015-16, which has resulted in the restoration of irrigation potential of 131.46 thousand hectares, including Rs 16.41 crore to the State of Utter Pradesh for restoration of 2.35 thousand hectares of irrigation potential. Under the World Bank funded DRIP (2012-2021), physical rehabilitation of 223 dams has been completed at a cost of Rs 2,567 crore. This scheme also had provision for need based de-siltation of few reservoirs to restore their lost capacity to the extent possible. Government of India is implementing Phase II and Phase III of externally funded scheme DRIP (2021-2031). The scheme has provisions for physical rehabilitation of 736 dams. The scheme has provisions similar to DRIP Phase-I for carrying out need based de-siltation of selected reservoirs. The proposed sediment management interventions under the scheme include inter alia catchment area treatment, de-siltation of reservoirs etc. The Ministry of Jal Shakti has formulated a “National Framework for Sediment Management” for managing sediments in a holistic manner. This framework lays emphasis on sediment management through integrated river basin management plan. It provides reference of all existing guidelines / policies dealing with the various aspects of sediment management for facilitating the stakeholders, particularly State Governments, in planning strategies and implementation of projects for sediment management in watershed, rivers, reservoirs, lakes/water bodies etc. CWC has published “Handbook for Assessing and Managing Reservoir Sedimentation” in the year 2019. The main objective of this handbook is to synthesize procedures, methods, technology and practices that are helpful to assess sediment related concerns, and subsequently to manage them considering feasibility and impacts of selected measures. This information was given by the Minister of State for Jal Shakti, Shri Bishweswar Tudu in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.'),\n",

The census provides a comprehensive inventory of India's water resources, including natural and man-made water bodies like ponds, tanks, lakes, and more, and to collect data on the encroachment of water bodies. The Census also highlighted disparities between rural and urban areas and varying levels of encroachment and revealed crucial insights into the country's water resources. The census was launched under the centrally sponsored scheme, “Irrigation Census” in convergence with the 6th Minor Irrigation Census in order to have a comprehensive national database of all water bodies. The information on all important aspects of the water bodies including their type, condition, status of encroachments, use, storage capacity, status of filling up of storage, etc was collected. It covered all the water bodies located in rural as well as urban areas that are in-use or not in-use. The census also took into account all type of uses of water bodies like irrigation, industry, pisciculture, domestic/ drinking, recreation, religious, ground water recharge etc. Census has been successfully completed and the All India and State-wise reports have been published. The key features/findings of the Census are as follows:\\n\\n'Incredible India' is endowed with diverse and distinct water bodies. Water is an important aspect for development which it is linked with every Sustainable Development Goal. It is essential and fundamental for life itself. Water is a recyclable resource but its availability is limited and the gap between the supply and demand is widening over time. Therefore, concerted efforts are needed to conserve and preserve water bodies. Ministry of Jal Shakti is the nodal ministry responsible for laying down policy guidelines and programmes for the development, conservation and management of water as a national resource. The Ministry has multidimensional approach towards water sector, on one hand it is spearheading the ambitious programmes\\xa0 on providing safe and adequate drinking water to every household in the country, eliminating open defecation in rural areas, rejuvenation of river Ganga and its tributaries, improving the safety and operational performance of existing dams, etc and on the other hand, it is involved in assessment, development and regulation of the country’s water resources through technical guidance, scrutiny, clearance and monitoring. The finalization of results and completion of this report has been made possible by the strenuous efforts of all the officers and staff of Minor Irrigation (Stat) Wing of the Ministry of Jal Shakti under the supervision and support of Secretary, Department of Water Resources, RD & GR, Ministry of Jal Shakti, Shri Pankaj Kumar, as well as dedicated technical support provided by National Informatics Centre and determined efforts made by the State/UT Governments. The IEC Division of the Ministry is ensuring dissemination of the Census report across the nation and especially for planners, research scholars, agricultural and water scientists, policy makers, administrators and all other stakeholders in this sector.

All the villages had declared themselves ODF by 2nd October, 2019. Having achieved the ODF status, Phase-II of SBM(G) has been launched with effect from 1st April 2020 for a period of 5 years with the objectives to sustain the ODF status and to make arrangements for solid and liquid waste management (SLWM) in all villages, i.e. to convert the villages from ODF to ODF Plus, by 2024-25. In SBM(G) Phase-II, provision for incentive for construction of individual household latrines (IHHLs) for any left out household and new households has been kept. SBM(G) is a demand driven scheme, hence no specific targets of construction of Individual Household Latrines (IHHLs) can be set. However, it has been estimated that during the SBM-G Phase-II period, about 30 lakh household will require IHHLs annually. As SBM(G) is a demand driven programme, no specific year-wise targets of construction of IHHLs could be set.

The overall financial commitment for Jal Jeevan Mission is INR 3600 billion (US $ 43.80 billion) which makes it one of the largest welfare programmes in the world. At the time of the launch of the Mission in August 2019, out of 19.43 Crore rural households, only 3.23 Crore (16.65%) had access to tap water. Despite several disruptions in recent years due to the Pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict etc., States/ UTs have made persistent efforts to implement the Jal Jeevan Mission. The country crossed another milestone in the journey towards ‘Har Ghar Jal’ on 4th April 2023, with over 11.66 Crore (60%) rural households provided with tap water supply in their homes. 5 states of Gujarat, Telangana, Goa, Haryana, and Punjab and 3 Union Territories of Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Daman Diu & Dadra Nagar Haveli and Puducherry have reported 100% coverage. The country is steadily progressing towards covering all the rural households will have safe drinking water through taps. Jal Jeevan Mission is not merely an infrastructure development programme. The focus in the Mission is on service delivery in terms of sufficiency, safety, and regularity of water supply. The speed and scale of implementation of JJM has been unprecedented. In just about 3 years, more than 8.42 crore rural households with more than 40 crore people (@4.95 persons per rural household, source IMIS) have been benefitted under the programme. This is more than the population of USA (33.1 crore), almost twice the population of Brazil (21 crore) and Nigeria (20 crore), and more than thrice the population of Mexico (12.8 crore) & Japan (12.6 crore). With focus on health and well-being of children, special efforts have been made to provide tap water connection in all rural schools, anganwadi centres and ashramshalas (tribal residential schools) for drinking, cooking mid-day meal, hand washing and use in toilets. As on date, tap water supply has been provided in 9.03 lakh (88.26%) schools and 9.36 lakh (83.71%) anganwadi centres. “Supply of safe water” has been one of the key considerations under the JJM. At the time of launch of JJM, there were 14,020 Arsenic and 7,996 Fluoride affected reported habitations in the country. In a short span of 3 years, since the launch of JJM, with concerted efforts of states/UTs, the number of such habitations has reduced to 612 and 431 respectively. Even in these habitations, safe water is now available for drinking and cooking, to all the people. In effect, all 1.79 crore people livening in Arsenic or Fluoride affected habitations, are now getting safe water for drinking and cooking purposes. 2,078 water testing labs have been developed out of which 1,122 are NABL accredited. To create awareness about water quality, more than 21 lakh women have been trained in rural areas for testing water samples using Field Test Kits (FTKs). In 2022-23 alone, 1.03 crore water samples have been tested through the FTKs and 61 lakh water samples have been tested through laboratories. A special ‘Swachh Jal se Suraksha’ campaign was launched by the Mission and water quality testing have been reported in 5.33 lakh villages for chemical and in 4.28 lakh villages for biological contamination (post monsoon) during the year 2022-23. The strength of government’s water quality surveillance efforts is evidenced from the fact that more than 1.64 crore water samples have been tested in 2022-23 alone, more than three times the number of samples tested in 2018-19 (50 lakhs). These efforts are likely to lead to significant reduction in cases of water borne diseases in the country. Following the bottom-up approach, JJM is being implemented as a decentralized, demand-driven community-managed programme. More than 5.24 lakh Paani Samitis/ Village Water and Sanitation Committees (VWSC) have been formed and over 5.12 lakh Village Action Plan have been prepared under Jal Jeevan Mission to manage, operate, and maintain in-village water supply infrastructure. With an active participation of people especially women, and rural communities working together, Jal Jeevan Mission has truly become a people’s movement, i.e. 'Jan Andolan'. For long term drinking water security, local communities and Gram Panchayats are coming forward and taking responsibility to manage in village water supply systems, their water resources and grey water\\nThe States/ UTs are extending support to the Panchayats by engaging Implementation Support Agencies (ISAs) to facilitate constitution of VWSC, community mobilization, support in preparing Village Action Plan and carry out activities post infrastructure construction. More than 14 thousand ISAs have been engaged, which are actively working in the field. For building capacity and to reorient the different stakeholders, 99 reputed Governmental and non- Governmental academic institutions/ agencies/ firms/ organizations/ think tanks/ training institutions, etc. are engaged as Key Resource Centres (KRCs). Capacity building of more than 18,000 people is done through Key Resource Centres empaneled under Jal Jeevan Mission. Further, to supplement the efforts and support the States/ UTs, Department of Drinking Water & Sanitation have formalized a Rural Wash Partners’ Forum (RWPF), where development partners along with sector partners involved in WASH sector have come forward to work in a collaborative manner with Government of India and State/ UTs for effective implementation of Jal Jeevan Mission. Sustainability of ground and spring water sources is critical for sustained service delivery in rural households in the long term. It is in this context, “Source sustainability for Drinking Water” (JSA-2023-SSDW) has been kept as the central theme of Jal Shakti Abhiyan 2023. This will bring the necessary focus on water conservation for improving and sustaining the sources of drinking water supply, specially ground water sources and springs. Jal Jeevan Mission is impacting the society in multiple ways. Regular tap water supply relieves women and young girls, from the drudgery of carrying heavy headloads of water to meet their daily household needs. On the other side, women can utilize the time saved from collecting water, for income generation activities, for learning new skills and for supporting their children’s education. The adolescent girls no longer have to miss school for helping their mother in collection of water. A study by Nobel Laureate Dr. Michael Kremer and his team has brought out that nearly 30% infant deaths can be reduced if safe water is made available to families for drinking. Diarrhea is a very common ailment especially among new-born children. The newborns are more susceptible to water ailments. The study draws a conclusion that 1 in every 4 deaths, (1.36 lakh under five deaths per annum) pertaining to children below 5 years, and can be prevented in India with provision of safe water. The JJM is also creating both direct and indirect employment opportunities in rural areas. A preliminary survey by IIM Bengaluru has assessed that about 1,47,55,980 person-year of employment can be created during the five-year period of implementation of JJM. This works out to be an average of 29,51,196 people employed in each year for the full year in the construction phase of the Mission. The Mission also will lead to employment of almost 10.92 lakh people every year for operation and maintenance of the piped water supply schemes. A huge milestone as 60% of households in our villages now have functional taps with clean water flowing through them. #JalJeevanMission empowered by our PM @narendramodi ji’s vision of #HarGharJal has made this possible in record time. pic.twitter.com/DMbq7aX1Oe\\n*****\\nAS\\n\"),\n",

At the time of announcement of Jal Jeevan Mission, 3.23 Crore (17%) households were reported to have tap water connections. Since then, more than 8.41 Crore rural households have been provided with tap water connection. As a result, today more than 11.64 Crore (59.9%) rural households have provision of tap water connection. The State-wise status of the rural households with tap water connections including Uttar Pradesh is annexed. As reported by States/ UTs as on 04.04.2023, out of 16.96 lakh habitations in the country, 16.77 lakh habitations having 99.25% population have access to potable water supply with drinking water sources at reasonable distance. Under Jal Jeevan Mission, as per existing guidelines, Bureau of Indian Standards’ IS:10500 standard is to be adopted for ensuring safe drinking water supply. States/UTs have been advised to undertake testing of water quality on a periodic basis i.e. once in year for chemical and physical parameters, and twice in a year for bacteriological parameters and take remedial action wherever necessary, to ensure that the water supplied to households is of prescribed quality. To enable States/ UTs to test water samples for water quality, and for sample collection, reporting, monitoring and surveillance of drinking water sources, an online JJM – Water Quality Management Information System (WQMIS) portal has been developed. As reported by States/UTs on WQMIS, 61.01 lakh water samples have been tested in the water testing laboratories and 103.81 lakh water samples using Field Testing Kits, during 2022-23. The State–wise details of water quality test reported through WQMIS are available in public domain on JJM Dashboard and can also be accessed at:\\nhttps://ejalshakti.gov.in/WQMIS/Main/report\\nAs reported by States/UTs, as on date, there are 2,078 drinking water quality testing laboratories at different levels viz. State, district, sub-division and/ or block level in the country. To encourage water quality testing to ensure potable drinking water supply, States/ UTs have opened water quality testing laboratories to general public for testing of their water samples at a nominal rate. States/ UTs have been advised to identify and train 5 persons preferably women from every village to conduct water quality testing using FTKs/ bacteriological vials at village level and report the same on the WQMIS portal. So far, as reported by states/UTs, about 21.45 lakh women have been trained. Under JJM, while allocating the funds to States/ UTs, 10% weightage is given to the population residing in habitations affected by chemical contaminants. States/ UTs have been advised to plan and implement piped water supply schemes of bulk water transfer based on safe water sources such as surface water sources or alternative safe ground water sources for the villages with water quality issues. Since, planning, implementation and commissioning of piped water supply scheme based on a safe water source may take time, purely as an interim measure, States/ UTs have been advised to install community water purification plants (CWPPs) especially in Arsenic and Fluoride affected habitations to provide potable water to every household at the rate of 8–10 litre per capita per day (lpcd) to meet their drinking and cooking requirements.

The MoU aims to bring the student community to the forefront of the mass movement for creating a sustainable ecosystem of our rivers. Apart from seeking active public participation, the event will also be historical towards creating knowledge-based short-term programmes, training sessions, and fostering more research on the water sector. Through the NMCG initiative, many higher educational institutions pledged their support towards the cause of river rejuvenation and water conservation and create holistic platforms for younger generations to become conscious participants towards a sustainable ecosystem. The theme of the event was ‘Igniting Young Minds, Rejuvenating Rivers’. Addressing the gathering, Union Minister for Jal Shakti, Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat asserted “water is not just an important factor or commodity but no life can be imagined without water and that makes effective water management absolutely essential”. Shri Shekhawat stated that ensuring cleanliness and purity of River Ganga with the rejuvenation of rivers are the prime objectives of the Namami Gange Mission. “Water is a crucial factor to sustain life. India’s cultural history saw water as the holiest source that sustains life in all forms, and over time that culture has eroded. We as a society have immense responsibility to revive that culture.”\\n\\nThe Union Minister pointed out certain impacting factors on the development of children including parents, who, in the Indian tradition, used to talk about various aspects of life including nature, culture, country, duties etc. Teachers, he said, also play an important role in creating an impact on the children and, therefore, it becomes, imperative for the teachers to inculcate respect towards natural resources as per our traditional wisdom and practices through educational frameworks. The Union Minister said, likewise, celebrities, media, judiciary and other members of the civil society must come together and start discussing and debating issues related to our natural resources, especially water, to make India a water wise country. He suggested organising debates and other competitions in the universities to spread awareness on importance of water conservation and river rejuvenation and urged the leading educators to strive to make their campuses green and water efficient. Shedding light on the fact that agriculture sector uses the bulk of India’s water resources, he said that demand side management is the need-of-the-hour. “The world is appreciating us and India has invested more than 240 billion dollars in the water sector but the challenge in front of us is also enormous and we must all play our part in contributing to conserve water and increase water use efficiency,” he said, adding, “We are not the owners of our natural resources but only custodians and it is everyone’s duty to return to the future generation as we inherited from our forefathers.”\\n\\nHe reiterated the importance of the 5Ps espoused by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to make such programmes successful including political will, public spending, partnership public participation and persuasion. He said that today nearly 50 universities are signing the MoU and it is not just 50 people joining hands but thousands who would eventually become part of this movement. Delivering the keynote address, Shri G. Asok Kumar said that everyone knows the importance of water and what we are looking for with various collaborations is to spread the net far and wide to catch as many ambassadors of water and rivers as we can. “Water sector was not given the attention it deserves and viewed as just a water resource. This has changed with the vision of the Prime Minister, who has given a clarion call to make Jal Andolan a Jan Andolan,” DG, NMCG said, adding, “It is the younger generations that will be bearing the brunt of the water scarcity and therefore it is most necessary to ignite them to start respecting water, which was ingrained in our traditional values. We have to bring back the respect towards water and rivers, which is there in our Puranas and our traditional wisdom.”\\nIn the context of the collaboration between Namami Gange and academic institutions, DG, NMCG said that like Jan Bhagidari, today, we are moving forward in the direction of ‘Gyan Bhagidari’. He also drew similarities between the Jal Shakti and the power of the youth, both of which could go astray and wreak havoc if not channelized in a proper way. DG, NMCG congratulated all the participants and dignitaries from the academia and urged them to take steps in the direction of bringing back the respect for water among the young students in their institutions. He also said that Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain: Where it Falls, When it Falls campaign launched by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi on the occasion of the World Water Day 2021 is a noble way of nudging people to conserve more water. “More than 4.7 million water harvesting structures were made as part of that campaign,” he noted,\\nDG, NMCG informed that Namami Gange has been recognised by the United Nations as one of the top ten World Restoration Flagship and said that India also participated in the UN World Water Conference 2023 which was organised at the UN Headquarters in New York after a gap of more than 40 years. “It was a rare privileged moment for us as people initially thought it was impossible to clean Ganga but a lot of success has been achieved in the mainstream of River Ganga evidenced in the form of improved water quality and thriving biodiversity, especially the Gangetic Dolphins. We were picked from among 170 countries around the globe The focus is now on the tributaries of Ganga.”\\nDG, NMCG said at the global stage programmes like Swachh Bharat Mission, Jal Jeevan Mission and Namami Gange, covering various aspects of the river rejuvenation, are being acknowledged. He said that India needs more social skills, technology solutions, and data management to make further strides in the water sector. He further said that a need to develop a worldwide network of universities is being felt and in that context, today marks a historic day in connecting with the important stakeholders to make Namami Gange a Jan Andolan – universities and students. He said that the MoU signing represents collaboration on areas in pursuit of academic excellence in the field of water quality, environmentally sustainable development to public outreach, and a step towards creating an enabling environment for the provisions of Arth Ganga. He concluded by saying that with Namami Gange Mission being a stellar success story, the lessons through its journey can now be incorporated towards cleaning other rivers of the country. Additional Secretary and Mission Director, National Water Mission, Ms. Archana Varma emphasized on the fact that the younger generation is more aware and knows the importance of a sustainable earth and a lot can be learnt from them. She said that water is a precious gift of nature but it is a limited resource. “We have had a reverential and close connection with water and Indian culture for centuries has thrived because of that symbiotic relationship,” she said, adding, “3 out of 4 jobs in the world are related to water, and if water becomes scarce, there looms a threat of unemployment for the masses.” She emphasized the importance of dialogue and people’s participation to involve younger generations in the water sector. She recalled a ‘Mann ki Baat’ address by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in 2019 which became the basis of the ‘Catch the Rain: Where it Falls, When it Falls’ campaign and said that water has to become everyone’s business. She discussed the five goals of the National Water Mission – water data in public to mitigate impacts of climate change, partnerships with key players, spotting vulnerable areas, increasing water use efficiency, and integrating river basin management. She pointed out the importance of more industry investment and startups to create more employment and educate the young generations regarding the untapped potential in the water sector. “We don’t have institutions of excellence in the water sector. We don’t have water auditors,” she said, adding, “There is a need for water departments in university spaces. This will help to establish an accelerated growth based development of the country wherein the water will be a very important dimension to it”.

Sitharam spoke about Ganga being a lifeline of the Indo-Gangetic belt. “India is not running out of water, rather water is running out of India”, he said. With India being a rainfall-rich country, we have the most significant issue of storage that needs to be resolved at the earliest. He noted the PM Shri Narendra Modi’s call for Amrit Sarovar that is proving to be the need-of-the-hour and can effectively address the issue of water storage in the country. He also noted that Catch the Rain, river rejuvenation, and rainwater harvesting are essential for India’s economic growth. The younger generation, especially students, could very well be the foot soldiers to spread more knowledge about water conservation in rural areas. “If we want India to be a 5 trillion economy, then our villages need to be self-sufficient”. The MoU signing ceremony is the culmination of the monthly webinar series ‘Igniting Young Minds: Rejuvenating Rivers’ that was organised by NMCG with the leading educators including Chancellors, Vice-Chancellors, Deans or other academic decision-makers of the universities. The objective of the monthly webinars was to create awareness among the youth on the importance of river rejuvenation, conservation, cleanliness, agricultural practices, and water reuse. The Webinar series was a success with the active participation of academic leaders and students from top universities, creating a buzz within the community. The event – Namami Gange: Universities Connect – was organised by the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) and APAC News Network in New Delhi. Shri G.'),\n",

Water being a State subject, steps for augmentation, conservation and efficient management of water resources are primarily undertaken by the respective State Governments. In order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, Central Government provides technical and financial assistance to them through various schemes and programmes. In order to effectively implement the rainwater harvesting across the country, the Government undertakes various activities in the form of special drives, schemes and programmes. Some of the major steps taken by Government of India in this regard are as follows:\\nJal Shakti Abhiyan-I (JSA-I) was conducted in 2019 in 1,592 blocks out of 2,836 blocks in 256 water stressed districts of the country and was expanded as “Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain” (JSA:CTR) in 2021 with the theme “Catch the Rain Where it Falls When it Falls” to cover all the blocks of all districts (rural as well as urban areas) across the country. “Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain” (JSA:CTR) -2022 campaign, the third in the series of JSAs, was launched on 29.03.2022 to cover all the blocks of all districts (rural as well as urban areas) across the country. In the current year, Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain 2023, 4th in the series of JSA, has been launched on 04.03.2023. Rainwater harvesting is one of the major components of the campaign. States/UTs have been advised to actively participate in JSA:CTR 2023 and have also been suggested to undertake rain harvesting activities under JSA:CTR. As per the information available, the following water related works/ afforestation works have been completed/ ongoing during the period 29.03.2022 to 03.03.2023:\\nWater related works across the country in JSA: CTR 2022\\nWater Conservation and Rainwater Harvesting Structures\\n12,28,553\\nRenovation of Traditional Water Bodies\\n2,67,472\\n\\nReuse and Recharge Structures\\n8,74,680\\nWatershed Development\\n16,28,726\\nIntensive Afforestation\\n78,38,36,035\\nGovernment of India is implementing Atal Bhujal Yojana, a Central Sector Scheme with an outlay of Rs. 6,000 crore in identified water stressed areas of 8,220 Gram Panchayats (GPs) under 229 blocks in 80 districts of 7 States viz.

GoI is supplementing the efforts of the State Governments in addressing the challenges of pollution of river Ganga and its tributaries by providing financial and technical assistance under Namami Gange Programme. The main objective of river rejuvenation programme is to meet the primary water quality criteria for outdoor bathing notified by Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEF& CC). Cleaning of river is a continuous process and Government of India is supplementing the efforts of the State Governments in addressing the challenges of pollution in river Ganga and its tributaries by providing financial and technical assistance under Namami Gange Programme. Under this programme, a diverse set of interventions for cleaning and rejuvenation of river Ganga has been taken up including waste water treatment, solid waste management, river front management (ghats and crematoria development), maintaining continuous flow, rural sanitation, afforestation, biodiversity conservation and Public Participation etc. Under Namami Gange Programme, a comprehensive set of interventions such as wastewater treatment, solid waste management, river front management (Ghats and Crematoria development), e-flow, afforestation, biodiversity conservation and Public Participation etc. have been taken up for rejuvenation of river Ganga and its tributaries. So far, till February, 2023, a total of 424 projects have been taken up at an estimated cost of Rs. 35,414 Crore, out of which 243 projects have been completed and made operational. Majority of the projects pertain to creation of sewage infrastructure as the untreated domestic/industrial wastewater is the main reason for pollution in the river. 182 sewerage infrastructure projects have been taken up with a cost of Rs. 28,744 Crore for creation & rehabilitation of 5658 Million Litres per Day (MLD) of Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) capacity and laying of around 5206 KM sewerage network. Among these, 105 sewerage projects have been completed resulting in creation & rehabilitation of 2,173 MLD of STP capacity and laying of 4,362 KM sewerage network. Based on the water quality assessment by CPCB in 5 Ganga main stem States in 2022, the observed water quality indicates that median value of dissolved oxygen, which is an indicator of river health has been found to be within acceptable limits of notified primary bathing water quality criteria and satisfactory to support the ecosystem of river for almost entire stretch of river Ganga.Further, as a result of multi sectoral interventions as per comparison of median data of water quality parameter viz. Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Faecal Coliforms (FC) of year 2014 and 2022, DO median has improved at 32 locations, BOD median has improved at 41 locations and FC median has improved at 27 locations respectively. The outputs of these projects have started yielding results and the water quality will further improve once all the projects which are at various stages of implementation are operationalized. National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) has received 121 public grievances related to pollution abatement and rejuvenation issues during the financial year 2022-23 and all of these 121 grievances have been redressed. Namami Gange Programme was launched in June 2014 for a period up to 31st March, 2021 to rejuvenate River Ganga and its tributaries. The programme was subsequently extended up to 31stMarch, 2026.

Out of 13.96 lakh members added during the month, around 7.38 lakh new members have come under ambit of EPFO for the first time. Among the newly joined members, highest enrolment is registered in the age-group of 18-21 years with 2.17 lakh members, followed by the age-group of 22-25 years with 1.91 lakh members. The age-group of 18-25 years constitutes 55.37% of total new members during the month. This indicates that majority of the members joining organised sector workforce of the country are first-time job seekers. The data also highlights that approximately 10.15 lakh members re-joined EPFO membership which rose by 8.59% as compared to last year. These members switched their jobs and re-joined the establishments covered under EPFO and opted to transfer their accumulations instead of applying for final settlement thus, extending their social security protection. Gender-wise analysis of payroll data reflects that enrolment of net female members has been 2.78 lakh in February, 2023, which is around 19.93% of the net member addition for the month. Of these, 1.89 lakh female members are the new joinees. This is around 25.65% addition of all the new joinees. In terms of female participation, the net female member addition and new female member addition has registered highest proportion in the last four months. This indicates a growing trend of women participation in the organised workforce. State-wise payroll figures highlight that month-on-month growing trend in net member addition is reflected in the states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, West Bengal etc. In terms of net member addition, top 5 states are Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Gujarat, Delhi. These states together constitute 58.62% of net member addition during the month. Of all the states, Maharashtra is leading by adding 20.90% of net members followed by the state of Tamil Nadu with 11.92% during the month. The classification of industry-wise payroll data indicates that ‘Expert Services’ (consisting of manpower suppliers, normal contractors, security services, miscellaneous activities etc.) constitutes 41.17% of total member addition during the month. Comparing industry-wise data with that of previous month, higher enrolments have been noticed in industries namely, ‘leather products’, ‘garment-making’, ‘establishments engaged in rendering courier services’, ‘fish processing and non-veg food preservation’ etc. The payroll data is provisional since the data generation is a continuous exercise, as updating employee record is a continuous process. The previous data hence gets updated every month. From the month of April-2018, EPFO has been releasing payroll data covering the period September, 2017 onwards. In monthly payroll data, the count of members joining EPFO for the first time through Aadhaar validated Universal Account Number (UAN), existing members exiting from coverage of EPFO and those who exited but re-joining as members, is taken to arrive at net monthly payroll. EPFO is a social security organization responsible for providing social security benefits in the form of Provident, Pension and Insurance Funds to the organised workforce of the country covered under the provisions of Employees’ Provident Funds & Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952. ***\\nMJPS/SSV\\n'),\n",

Dedicated efforts have also been made to make the process of pilgrim selection objective, transparent, efficient, timely and without human involvement. The applications for Haj and selection of pilgrims was done online. Out of a total of 1.84 lakh applications received, 14,935 Haj applicants have been given assured allotment (including 10,621 in 70+ age category and 4,314 Ladies Without Mehram (LWM). This is the largest ever contingent of women proceeding on Haj alone without a male member . The \\xa0applications received over and above the Haj quota have been finalised through an Online Randomized Digital Selection (ORDS) process, without any human intervention. It is for the first time that the list of selected and waitlisted applicants has been published on the official portal immediately after the selection process, for the general public, in the interest of increased transparency. All 1.4 Lakhs selected pilgrims have been sent SMS informing them of their selection for Haj 2023. SMS has also been sent to waitlisted pilgrims informing them about their waitlisted status and position in the waitlist. The Ministry of Minority Affairs has partnered with State Bank of India(SBI) to make special arrangements to provide Forex facilities to the pilgrims. Unlike earlier years, when each pilgrim was made available 2100 Riyals by the Haj Committee of India, irrespective of his actual requirements, Haj Policy 2023 gives the option and flexibility to the pilgrims to arrange their own foreign currency or take lesser foreign exchange, as per their individual requirements. The Government has collaborated with SBI, to ensure supply of Forex to the pilgrims at the most competitive rates. With more than 22,000 branches all over India, SBI shall facilitate providing FOREX and mandatory insurance for all the pilgrims, to meet the requirements during their stay in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The bank will reach out to the pilgrims in this connection by way of SMS. Facility of FOREX Card is also being provided to all the pilgrims thereby eliminating the possibility of theft or loss of physical currency. In case this card is lost during the pilgrimage, the pilgrim can get his money refunded from the bank. SBI will also arrange stalls at all Embarkation points, with dedicated focal point/nodal officer of appropriate level, to facilitate the pilgrims for collection of FOREX in cash or through the Forex Card and also to provide any guidance and help as may be required.

The event, supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), focused on diversifying and securing renewable energy (RE) and critical mineral supply chains for energy transitions, including promoting circularity in value chains. In his keynote address Mr Bhupinder Singh Bhalla, Secretary, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), Government of India said, “India, under its G20 presidency, takes pride in hosting leaders, experts, government officials, energy sector financiers and other key players to focus on the critical need for a cost-effective and risk-proof scale-up of clean energy through diversified supply chains and distributive expansion of manufacturing base. We hope and expect that the deliberations today will help identify a set of collective changes that will put the world on the path to rapid scaling-up of renewable energy, while ensuring energy security, affordability and better quality of life for our people.” Mr Bhalla noted that a series of economic disruptions have exposed the world to risks that are slowing down the pace of the global clean energy transition and have raised concerns about energy security. Mr Bhupinder Singh Bhalla, Secretary, MNRE, delivering the keynote at the second Energy Transitions Working Group meeting side event, ‘Diversifying Renewables & Critical Minerals Supply Chains to Advance Energy Transition’, on 3 April 2023 in Gandhinagar, Gujarat. While setting the context for the meeting, Mr Vivek Bharadwaj, Secretary, Ministry of Mines, noted in his keynote address that the majority of critical mineral reserves are in 15 countries. “The human race has fought many crises – whether the Ozone layer depleting, the Covid pandemic or the energy crisis in the 1970s. I am sure we will be able to address the criticality of minerals too and the Indian government is working towards making the country secure,” he said.

Ms Mamta Verma, Principal Secretary, Energy & Petrochemicals, Government of Gujarat, talked about the role of Gujarat in fulfilling India’s renewable energy targets. “Gujarat has been aggressive in its renewable energy policies and stepping up manufacturing capabilities. We need to develop a good framework to strengthen supply chains, a robust R&D mechanism, and more renewable energy parks so that manufacturing hubs can come up.”\\nEnergy Transition Working Group Chair Mr Alok Kumar, Secretary, Ministry of Power, said that the consensus in the recent Energy Transitions Working Group meetings has been that renewables will have an important role in reaching net-zero targets, and accessible supply chains will be important. “For a large country like India, diversification of supply chains will mean a lot of local manufacturing, thus generating green jobs. A circular economy and alternative technologies for battery storage will be key too,” he said. Dr Arunabha Ghosh, CEO, CEEW, emphasised that a speedy, resilient and inclusive transition to renewable energy will only be possible if countries can secure access to uninterrupted and affordable supply chains of key technologies. “Through its G20 Presidency, India could promote comprehensive tracking of global RE manufacturing capacity and trade flows to inform expansion and diversification strategies, and foster competition in trade,” he added. The event, which convened leading experts in the sector from industry, academia and policy-making, saw the launch of two reports – CEEW's ‘Developing Resilient Renewable Energy Supply Chains for Global Clean Energy Transition’, and CEEW, International Energy Agency (IEA), Institute of Transportation Studies UC Davis and World Resources Institute India (WRII)’s report ‘Addressing Vulnerabilities in the Supply Chain of Critical Minerals’.

And annual battery deployments need to increase 50 times and 28 times respectively to enable the transition of the power and mobility sectors. A risk-proof transition to renewables would only be possible if countries are able to secure access to uninterrupted and affordable supply chains of RE technologies like solar, wind, batteries and hydrogen. India already ranks fourth in the world in terms of installed capacity of renewable energy and is fast accelerating to meet its net zero by 2070 target. However, many minerals used to build clean energy technologies are rare, and often concentrated in a few geographies. One major advantage of mineral-dependent technologies is their ability to be reused and recycled continuously. This could help maintain a reliable supply of these materials through appropriate technologies and infrastructure. Promoting circularity will also help strengthen the mineral value chains. In its G20 year, the principles of India’s Mission LiFE (Lifestyle for Environment) can promote circularity in manufacturing and use of these minerals for a transition to renewables.

These annual bids of ISTS (Inter-State Transmission) connected renewable energy capacity will also include setting up of wind power capacity of at least 10 GW per annum. The plan finalized by Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) at a meeting chaired by Union Minister for Power & NRE Shri R. K. Singh last week, is in accordance with Prime Minister’s announcement at COP26, of achieving 500 GW of installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel (Renewable Energy + Nuclear) sources by 2030. India currently has a total renewable energy capacity of 168.96 GW (as on 28th February 2023) with about 82 GW at various stages of implementation and about 41 GW under tendering stage. This includes 64.38 GW Solar Power, 51.79 GW Hydro Power, 42.02 GW Wind Power and 10.77 GW Bio Power. Considering the fact that Renewable Energy (RE) projects take around 18-24 months for commissioning, the bid plan will add 250 GW of renewable energy and ensure 500 GW of installed capacity by 2030. The Ministry of Power is already working on upgrading and adding the transmission system capacity for evacuating 500 GW of electricity from non-fossil fuel. Speaking during the meeting, Shri R. K. Singh, Union Minister for Power & NRE said that the declaration of trajectory of short-term and long-term RE capacity addition by the Government is a significant step towards achieving the goal of 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030 and towards a faster energy transition. “India has emerged as one of the world leaders in Energy Transition and this is evident in the growth that we have achieved in the area of Renewable Energy. We are committed to achieve 500 GW of Target by 2030 and the bidding trajectory will provide a further stimulus towards this. The structured bidding trajectory will provide sufficient time to the RE developers to plan their finances, develop their business plans and manage the supply chain more efficiently This is a golden opportunity of industry to invest in this sector,” Shri Singh said. Shri B. S. Bhalla, Secretary, MNRE said that the bidding trajectory will also enable the power procurers, including the distribution companies, to manage their RE procurement plans effectively. “The bid trajectory will also provide a fillip to the RE manufacturing industry in the country by indicating the demand that would be created for their equipment,” the MNRE Secretary added. In addition to this, the Ministry has declared a quarterly plan of the bids for FY 2023-24, which comprises of bids for at least 15 GW of renewable energy capacity in each of the first and second quarters of the financial year (April-June 2023 and July-September 2023 respectively), and at least 10 GW in each of the third and fourth quarters of the financial year (Oct-December 2023 and January-March 2024 respectively). This capacity addition is over and above the RE capacities that would come up under schemes like Rooftop solar and PM-KUSUM of the Ministry, under which, bids issued directly by various States & also capacities that may come up under Open Access Rules. Presently, Solar Energy Corporation of India Ltd. (SECI), NTPC Ltd. and NHPC Ltd., are notified by the Government as Renewable Energy Implementing Agencies (REIAs) for calling such bids. It has been decided to also notify SJVN Ltd, a public sector enterprise under Government of India, as an REIA. The targeted bid capacity for FY 2023-24 would be allocated among the four REIAs. The REIAs would be permitted to bring out the bids for solar, wind, solar-wind hybrid, RTC RE power, etc. – all with/without storage, as per their assessment of the RE market or as per directions of the Government. *****\\nAM/\\n'),\n",

Background:\\nThe Nation celebrates 24th April of every year as National Panchayati Raj Day. 24th April marks a defining moment in the history of decentralization of power to the grassroots, with the institutionalization of Panchayati Raj, through the Constitution (73rd Amendment) Act, 1992 which came into force with effect from that day. Ministry of Panchayati Raj commemorates 24th April of every year as the National Panchayati Raj Day (राष्ट्रीय पंचायती राज दिवस) (NPRD), as the 73rd Constitutional Amendment came into force on this day. National Panchayati Raj Day is commemorated as a grand event on a big scale and is being generally held outside the National Capital. This year’s National Panchayati Raj Day holds a special significance as we would be commemorating 30 years of Panchayati Raj in India. This Constitution Amendment Act which introduced Part IX regarding Panchayats, has been a watershed initiative in our democratic polity ushering in an effective local governance at grassroots level. Since 2014 the Central Government has intensified its efforts to support the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) in the best manner possible to ensure that the basic objectives of the Panchayati Raj are achieved in true letter and spirit. Under the visionary leadership of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra\\xa0 Modi, India has seen a quantum\\xa0 leap in the allocation of fiscal resources to Panchayati Raj Institutions to support various infrastructure requirements and developmental activities in rural areas. Central Government has been taking many initiatives for strengthening and empowering Panchayati Raj Institutions, increasing the capacity of representatives of PRIs to fulfill their role and responsibilities and improving the efficiency, transparency of functioning and accountability of PRIs to contribute towards inclusive development, economic growth and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in nine themes i.e. (1) Poverty Free and Enhanced Livelihoods Village, (2) Healthy Village, (3) Child-Friendly Village, (4) Water Sufficient Village, (5) Clean and Green Village, (6) Village with Self-sufficient Infrastructure, (7) Socially Just & Socially Secured Village, (8) Village with Good Governance and (9) Women Friendly Village. eGramSwaraj (eGS) was launched on the occasion of National Panchayati Raj Day on \\xa024th April 2020 which was designed to operate as a single window solution for all day-to-day functioning of the Panchayats from Planning to Online Payments. After the clarion call by Prime Minister on National Panchayati Raj Day on 24 April 2020, the adoption of the application increased speedily. As on date eGramSwaraj has almost 100% usage and adoption across the country with more than 2.3 lakh Gram Panchayats and Traditional Local Bodies are already using it for online payments. Till date more than 1.35 Lakh crore payments have been effected online through this system. The grants spent through this system were primarily central finance commission grants and all funds for XV FC grants (worth Rs. 2.5 Lakh crores) are being expended through eGramSwaraj application only. In FY 2022-23, funds to the tune of nearly Rs. 50,000 crores were spent online by the Panchayats across India. The payments are made through Public Finance Management System (PFMS) directly to the vendor accounts. While the expenditure was being done online, the procurement was being made in the traditional methods of offline tenders etc. by the Panchayats. Hence, upon the endeavour of Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) and also as requested by many Panchayats across the country, it was decided that the procurement process shall also become a feature of eGramSwaraj. Therefore, MoPR and GeM collaborated to integrate eGramSwaraj and GeM, and the initiative of technical integration between eGramSwaraj and Government eMarketplace (GeM) applications was carried out. The objective is to enable the Panchayats to procure their goods and services through GeM leveraging the eGramSwaraj platform directly. This initiative shall take the benefits of online procurement through GeM to the lowest tier of governance and not just restricted to Central/State Government Ministries and Departments. Since Panchayats are already accustomed to using eGramSwaraj, procurement through GeM will be an extension to their online work and the fund management. SVAMITVA Scheme\\nSVAMITVA (Survey of Villages and Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Areas) is a Central Sector Scheme launched by the Prime Minister on 24th April 2020 on the occasion of the National Panchayati Raj Day. SVAMITVA Scheme aims to provide “Records of Rights”/ Property Cards to rural household owners of the inhabited area of the village. The scheme covers multifarious aspects viz. facilitating monetisation of properties and enabling bank loans; reducing property-related disputes; comprehensive village-level planning. It will further enhance the socio-economic profile of the Panchayats, making them self-sustainable. The Property Card generated under the Scheme provides the right of the property to the household in the rural abadi area. The Scheme covers each section of society including SCs, STs, differently-abled, minorities, women and other vulnerable groups. As on 31st March 2023, drone flying has been completed in 2.39 lakh villages which make up 63% of the overall target of 3.72 lakh villages, and Drone survey is completed in the state of Madhya Pradesh, UTs of Lakshadweep, Delhi, Dadra Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu. Property Cards of all the inhabited villages of Haryana followed by Uttarakhand, Puducherry, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and Goa have been prepared. With close coordination between the States and the Survey of India, a milestone of preparation of over 1.24 crore property Cards for nearly 74,000 villages is achieved.

The emphasis is on high Jan Bhagidari and public participation, and the new approach is to organise long term campaigns on themes that articulate the vision of new India and resonate with every Indian. With active participation of the Panchayati Raj Institutions in undertaking different activities as part of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, it has been possible to reach out to rural masses and sensitize them about the importance and objectives of the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav. The Ministry of Panchayati Raj has also made concerted efforts to create a suitable, conducive and positive environment for Localization of Sustainable Development Goals (LSDGs) through Panchayati Raj Institutions in rural India, and has been successful in disseminating the concept of Sustainable Development Goals among the rural masses – giving wings to the dreams and aspirations of rural India. Ministry of Panchayati Raj has been at the forefront in Localisation of Sustainable Development Goals (LSDGs) through Panchayati Raj Institutions in rural areas, and the Ministry of Panchayati Raj is continuously playing an important role in bringing together multiple stakeholders, setting clear strategic targets and in catalyzing the technical assistance of United Nations organizations to localize the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in rural areas. In response to clarion call given by the Prime Minister, the Panchayati Raj Institutions have started working towards setting Panchayat-specific targets, aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the right way and achieving the SDGs through localised strategy and a holistic Panchayat Development Plan and its proper implementation. Incentivization of Panchayats scheme is one of the central components of Centrally Sponsored scheme of revamped Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA). Under this scheme, ‘National Panchayat Awards’ are given to the best performing Panchayats, including financial incentives for award winning Panchayats, in recognition of their performances under various priority sectors/themes. Last year, the format, procedures and categories of the National Panchayat Awards were revised comprehensively to establish a multi-level competition aligning with the nine themes of LSDGs. It was envisioned that this will help in accelerating the pace of attainment of LSDGs. The initiatives which have been steered so far have yielded positive outcomes. Accordingly, this year’s National Panchayat Awards will be conferred for outstanding works in various thematic areas in making the Panchayats poverty free, healthy, child and women friendly, water sufficient, clean and green, self-sufficient infrastructure, socially just and secured and good governed Panchayats. Taking forward the vision of the Hon’ble Prime Minister of making India a self-reliant nation, the concerted efforts of the Ministry of Panchayati Raj to incentivize Panchayats based on their exemplary performance in nine thematic areas of LSDGs will supplement and accelerate progress towards achieving LSDGs targets for creation of self-reliant Panchayats to meet the United Nations 2030 Agenda. *****\\nPK\\n'),\n",

The Prime Minister expressed happiness that the Panchayats are implementing the government’s schemes for Gaaon aur Gareeb - villages and the poor, with full dedication. Referring to eGramSwaraj and GeM portal for public procurement at the Panchayat level, the Prime Minister said that it will ease the working of the Panchayats. He also mentioned the distribution of 35 lakh SVAMITVA Property Cards and projects worth 17000 crores regarding railways, housing, water and employment for the development of Madhya Pradesh. In the Amrit Kaal of Independence, the Prime Minister said, every citizen is working towards fulfilling the dream of a developed India with utmost dedication. He highlighted the importance of developing the social system, economy and Panchayati Raj system in the villages of India in order to create a developed nation and pointed out that the present government is working tirelessly to create a robust system in place and expanding its scope, unlike the previous governments that discriminated with the Panchayats. Throwing light on the lack of efforts made by the previous governments before 2014, the Prime Minister informed that the finance commission granted less than 70,000 crores which was a paltry amount when one considers the scale of the country, but after 2014, this grant was increased to more than 2 lakh crores. He also mentioned that merely 6,000 Panchayat Bhawans were constructed a decade before 2014, whereas the present government constructed more than 30,000 Panchayat Bhawans in the last 8 years. He also informed that less than 70 Gram Panchayats were connected with optical fiber compared to more than 2 lakh Gram Panchayats that got optical fiber connectivity after the present government came to power. He also noted the lack of faith shown in the existing Panchayati Raj system by the previous governments after India’s independence. Recalling the words of Mahatma Gandhi that ‘India lives in its villages’, the Prime Minister pointed out that the previous regime barely paid any heed to his ideology which resulted in the Panchayati Raj remaining neglected for decades. The Prime Minister said that today, Panchayats are coming up as the life force of India’s development. “Gram Panchayat Vikas Yojana is helping Panchayats to work effectively”, Shri Modi added. The Prime Minister said that the government is working ceaselessly to bridge the gap between villages and cities. Panchayats are being made smart in this age of the digital revolution. Technology is being harnessed in the projects being undertaken by the Panchayats. The Prime Minister gave the example of Amrit Sarovar where issues like the selection of sites and completion of the project are being done with the help of technology. He said the GeM portal for public procurement at the Panchayat level will make procurement by the Panchayats easy and transparent. Local cottage industry will find a strong avenue for their sales, the Prime Minister said. The Prime Minister talked about the benefit of technology in the PM Svamitva scheme. He informed that the scheme is changing the scene of property rights in villages and reducing disputes and litigation. The use of drone technology is ensuring property documents for the people without any discrimination. He informed that work of Property Card is completed in 75 thousand villages of the country. He praised the Madhya Pradesh Government for good work in this direction. Referring to the indifference to the development of Chhindwara, the Prime Minister blamed the thinking of certain political parties. He said that the ruling parties broke the trust of the rural poor by ignoring the basic needs of the rural areas after Independence. The Prime Minister emphasized that by discriminating against villages where half of the population of the country resides, the country can not progress. He said after 2014, the rural economy, facilities in villages and the interest of the villages were given the highest priority. He said schemes like Ujjwala, and PM Awas have left a deep impact in villages. He said out of 4.5 crore houses, 3 crore houses of PMAY are in rural areas and that too mostly, in the name of the women. Highlighting that the cost of every house constructed under PM Awas Yojna is more than 1 lakh, the Prime Minister said that the government has transformed the lives of crores of women from the country by making them ‘Lakhpati Didi’ (millionaires). He informed that more than 4 lakh families have performed Grih Pravesh in pucca houses today and congratulated the sisters who have now become homeowners. The Prime Minister also touched upon the PM Saubhagya Yojna and informed that out of the 2.5 crore houses that received electricity, most of the houses belonged to the rural areas and the Har Ghar Jal Yojna that resulted in tapped water connections to more than 9 crore rural households. He pointed out that approximately 60 lakh houses in Madhya Pradesh now have tapped water connections compared to 13 lakhs previously. Stressing the need for access to banks and bank accounts, the Prime Minister pointed out that most of the rural population neither had bank accounts nor availed of any services from banks. As a result, the Prime Minister continued, the monetary aid that was sent out to the beneficiaries got looted before it reached them. Throwing light on the Jan Dhan Yojna, the Prime Minister informed that bank accounts were opened for more than 40 crore residents from villages, and the reach of banks was widened through India Post Payments Bank via India Post Office. He also gave the example of Bank Mitras and trained Bank Sakhis that are helping the people of the villages in everything, be it farming or business. Shedding light on the great injustice caused to the villages of India by previous governments, the Prime Minister noted that money spending on villages was avoided as villages were not considered to be vote banks. The Prime Minister highlighted that the present government opened the doors of development of the villages by spending more than 3.5 lakh crores on Har Ghar Jal Yojana, lakhs of crores of rupees are spent on PM Awas Yojana, 1 lakh crore rupees is being spent to complete the irrigation projects lying incomplete for decades, and thousands of crores of rupees are being spent on PM Gramin Sadak Abhiyan. Even under PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, the Prime Minister continued, the government has transferred about Rs 2.5 lakh crores directly to the bank accounts of the farmers where about 90 lakh farmers of Madhya Pradesh have received 18,500 crore rupees as part of this scheme. “The farmers of Rewa have also received about Rs 500 crore from this fund”, he added. The Prime Minister noted that thousands of crores of rupees have reached the villages in addition to the increase in MSP, while in the Corona period, the government has been giving free rations to the poor for the last three years at a cost of more than Rs 3 lakh crores. Referring to the Mudra Yojna, the Prime Minister informed that the central government is creating employment and self-employment opportunities in the villages by providing assistance of Rs 24 lakh crore in the past years alone. Due to this, the Prime Minister said, crores of people have started their employment in the villages where women make for a huge number of beneficiaries. Shri Modi informed that in the last 9 years, 9 crore women have joined self-help groups including more than 50 lakh women from Madhya Pradesh, and the government is offering a loan of up to Rs 20 lakh without bank guarantee to every self-help group. “Women are now handling the command of many small-scale industries”, the Prime Minister remarked, referring to the ‘Didi Cafe’ set up by the state government in every district. Shri Modi congratulated the women power of Madhya Pradesh and informed that about 17,000 women associated with self-help groups have been elected as panchayat representatives in the last panchayat elections. Referring to the ‘Samaveshi Abhiyan launched today, the Prime Minister said that this will be a strong initiative for achieving Viksit Bharat through Sabka Vikas. “Every panchayat, every institution, every representative, every citizen of the country will have to unite for a developed India. This is possible only when every basic facility reaches 100% beneficiaries quickly and without any discrimination”, he said. The Prime Minister emphasized that Panchayats will have to spread awareness about new systems of agriculture. He especially stressed the need to propagate natural farming. He said Panchayats have a big role to play in the initiative for small farmers, fishermen, and animal husbandry. “When you get involved in every development-related activity, the collective efforts of the nation will get strengthened. This will become the energy for building a developed India in Amrit Kaal.”\\nHighlighting the projects of today, the Prime Minister mentioned the electrification of the Chhindwara-Nainpur-Mandla Fort rail line which will further ease the connectivity of the people of this region to Delhi-Chennai and Howrah-Mumbai while also benefiting the tribal population. He also mentioned the new trains that have also been flagged off today for Chhindwara-Nainpur and said that many towns and villages will be directly connected to their district headquarters in Chhindwara, Seoni, and going to Nagpur and Jabalpur will also become much easier. The Prime Minister noted the rich wildlife in the region and said that increasing connectivity will also boost tourism and create new employment opportunities. “This is the power of the double-engine government”, the Prime Minister said.'),\n",

The development of villages can lead to the overall progress of the country. The President said that Panchayats are not just a means of implementing government programs and initiatives, but also a place to encourage new leaders, planners, policy-makers, and innovators. By adopting the best practices of one Panchayat in other Panchayats, we can quickly develop and make our villages prosperous. The President said that for the holistic development of any society, the participation of women is very important. Women should have the right to make decisions for themselves, for their families and for the welfare of society. This right could be achieved through their empowerment at the family and village level. She was happy to note that out of more than 31.5 lakh elected representatives of local rural bodies 46 percent are women. She urged women to actively participate in the work of the Gram Panchayats. She also appealed to their families to support them in these efforts. Speaking on the occasion, the Union Minister of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj, Shri Giriraj Singh said there are 21 States that have made 50% reservation for women in the 3-tier Panchayats. He called upon the remaining States to provide reservation for women beyond the 33% Constitutional provision in the Panchayats. Calling for holistic development of Panchayats, Shri Giriraj Singh said we should plan a development model to take the Panchayats towards saturation of schemes on the basis of the nine themes as laid out under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. He said the Modi Government firmly believes the Panchayats have to be the focal point of development. “Earlier, the Government used to allocate just Rs.54 per person for development under the Finance Commission, it has now been increased to Rs.700,” he said. The Minister said the Government is providing several schemes for the welfare of citizens of the country. All these schemes including providing foodgrains under the Garib Kalyan package would not have been possible without the involvement of the Panchayats. “In this Amrit Kaal, 75th Year of Independence, and 30 years since the 73rd Constitutional Amendment related to Panchayati Raj, the time has come for the States to give the legal rights to the Panchayati Raj Institutions,” he said. Calling for saturation of schemes in the Panchayats by the line Ministries of the Centre and the States, Shri Giriraj Singh said 31 lakh elected representatives have been imparted training towards sustainable village under the Gram Swaraj Abhiyaan. “The parameters for determining the vibrant Panchayats have changed to include Carbon Neutrality, Water Sufficiency, Literacy and Employment Generation. Earlier, just about 10-20% Panchayats were participating, today more than 90% Panchayats have vied for the Awards,” he said. The Minister said the youngest Panchayats in Jammu & Kashmir UT have made commendable efforts towards the goal of achieving Carbon Neutrality by the year 2030. Shri Giriraj Singh said drone flights have been completed in more than 2.5 lakh villages, property cards have been given in more than 64,000 villages and over 57,000 rural residents have been provided property cards. Highlighting that Bhu-Aadhaar and SVAMITVA Schemes have a huge potential to transform rural India and benefit the rural populace, Shri Giriraj Singh said, “under the SVAMITVA Scheme, Drone Survey has been completed in more than 2.35 lakh villages whereas 6.57 lakh villages, viz 95% of 6.62 lakh villages have been provided with Bhu-Aadhaar under Unique Land Parcel Identification Number (ULPIN) project.”\\nLater, addressing the National Conference on Incentivization of Panchayats, Shri Faggan Singh Kulaste, Union Minister of State for Rural Development and Steel, extended best wishes to all well-performing Panchayats. While appreciating the awardee Panchayats for their valuable, remarkable and outstanding achievements, Shri Kapil Moreshwar Patil, MoS for Panchayati Raj, said that national award is the endorsement of the exemplary work done by Panchayats and the Best Practices should be replicated by other Panchayats. Shri Kapil Moreshwar Patil said that the country cannot develop without the development of the villages, and the Central Government provides adequate financial support to the States for the infrastructure development in rural areas. Shri Patil called for concerted efforts by all stakeholders to localize the SDGs and realize thematic goals in Gram Panchayats. In line with the Prime Minister’s vision towards maximizing digital technology for social benefit, Shri Giriraj Singh later launched the GS NIRNAY, National Initiative for Rural India to Navigate, InnovAte and Resolve PanchaYat decisions, a mobile application of the Ministry of Panchayati Raj aimed at empowering rural communities during the National Conference. Speaking on the occasion, Shri Giriraj Singh emphasized the need for enhancing rural governance through adoption of digital tools and technology. He stressed the importance of leveraging technology to enhance the reach, scope, and outcome of government actions in the course of development. He opined that the administrative capacity and effectiveness of regional and local governments must be enhanced, through the provision of technological tools and resources for playing a meaningful role in the course of development. In this pursuit, GS NIRNAY mobile app will be a game-changer for rural communities in India, providing them with easy access to critical information discussed during a Gram Sabha; acting as a means of verification of facts where necessary or in case of queries that may arise regarding the resolutions undertaken during the Gram Sabha. This would bring in more transparency and increase efficiency in the functioning of Panchayats, which play a vital role in decentralized participatory democracy. The launch of GS NIRNAY marks a significant step towards realizing the vision of 'Minimum Government, Maximum Governance' at the grassroots level, and is expected to accelerate the pace of rural transformation to achieve the vision of Gram Swaraj laid down by Mahatma Gandhi.

परियोजनाओं का शिलान्यास और लोकार्पण भी हुआ है। इसमें रेलवे के प्रोजेक्ट्स हैं, गरीबों को पक्के घर के प्रोजेक्ट्स हैं, पानी से जुड़ी परियोजनाएं हैं। गांव-गरीब का जीवन आसान बनाने वाले, रोज़गार का निर्माण करने वाले इन प्रोजेक्ट्स के लिए भी मैं आप सभी को बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूं।\\nसाथियों,\\nआजादी के इस अमृतकाल में, हम सभी देशवासियों ने विकसित भारत का सपना देखा है और उसे पूरा करने के लिए दिन रात मेहनत कर रहे हैं। भारत को विकसित बनाने के लिए, भारत के गांवों की सामाजिक व्यवस्था को विकसित करना जरूरी है। भारत को विकसित बनाने के लिए, भारत के गांवों की आर्थिक व्यवस्था को विकसित करना जरूरी है। भारत को विकसित बनाने के लिए, भारत के गांवों की पंचायती व्यवस्था को भी विकसित करना जरूरी है। इसी सोच के साथ हमारी सरकार, देश की पंचायती राज व्यवस्था को मजबूत करने के लिए लगातार काम कर रही है। पहले की सरकारों ने कैसे पंचायतों से भेदभाव किया और उनसे उल्टा कैसे हम उन्हें सशक्त कर रहे हैं, पंचायतों में सुविधाएं बढ़ा रहे हैं, ये आज गांव वाले भी देख रहे हैं, देश भर के लोग भी देख रहे हैं। 2014 के पहले पंचायतों के लिए वित्त आयोग का अनुदान 70 हजार करोड़ रुपए से भी कम था। आंकड़ा याद रखोगे आप? आंकड़ा याद रखोगे? कुछ आप बताओगे तो मुझे पता चलेगा याद रखोगे? 2014 से पहले 70 हजार करोड़ से कम क्या इतनी कम राशि से इतना बड़ा देश इतनी सारी पंचायतें कैसे अपना काम कर पातीं? 2014 में हमारी सरकार आने के बाद पंचायतों को मिलने वाला ये अनुदान 70 हजार से बढ़ाकर 2 लाख करोड़ रुपए से ज्यादा हो गया है। आप बताएंगे मैंने कितना बताया पहले कितना था? अब कितना हुआ? अब आप अंदाजा लगा सकते हैं काम कैसे करते हैं। मैं आपको दो और उदाहरण देता हूं। 2014 से पहले के 10 वर्षों में, मैं उन दस साल की बात करता हूं।\\xa0 केंद्र सरकार की मदद से 6 हजार के आसपास ही पंचायत भवन बनवाए गए थे। पूरे देश में करीब-करीब 6 हजार पंचायत घर बने थे। हमारी सरकार ने 8 साल के अंदर-अंदर 30 हजार से ज्यादा नए पंचायत भवनों का निर्माण करवा चुकी है। अब ये आंकड़ा भी बताएगा कि हम गांवों के लिए कितने समर्पित हैं। पहले की सरकार ने ग्राम पंचायतों तक ऑप्टिकल फाइबर पहुंचाने की योजना भी शुरू की थी। लेकिन उस योजना के तहत देश की 70 से भी कम 100 भी नहीं, 70 से भी कम ग्राम पंचायतों को ऑप्टिकल फाइबर से जोड़ा गया था। वो भी शहर के बाहर जो नजदीक में पंचायत पड़ती थी वहां पर गए थे। ये हमारी सरकार है,\\xa0 जो देश की दो लाख से ज्यादा पंचायतों तक ऑप्टिकल फाइबर को ले गई है। फर्क साफ है दोस्तों। आजादी के बाद की सरकारों ने कैसे भारत की पंचायती राज व्यवस्था को ध्वस्त किया, मैं इसके विस्तार में नहीं जाना चाहता। जो व्यवस्था आजादी के भी सैकड़ों वर्ष, हजारों वर्षों पहले से थी, उसी पंचायती राज व्यवस्था पर आजादी के बाद भरोसा ही नहीं किया गया। पूज्य बापू कहते थे, भारत की आत्मा गांवों में बसती है। लेकिन कांग्रेस ने गांधी के विचारों को भी अनसुना कर दिया। नब्बे के दशक में पंचायती राज के नाम पर खानापूर्ति जरूर की गई, लेकिन फिर भी पंचायतों की तरफ वो ध्यान नहीं दिया गया, जिसकी जरूरत थी।\\nसाथियों,\\n2014 के बाद से, देश ने अपनी पंचायतों के सशक्तिकरण का बीड़ा उठाया है। और आज इसके परिणाम नजर आ रहे हैं। आज भारत की पंचायतें, गांवों के विकास की प्राणवायु बनकर उभर रही हैं। ग्राम पंचायतें, गांव की आवश्यकता के अनुसार गांव का विकास करें इसके लिए ग्राम पंचायत विकास योजना बनाकर काम किया जा रहा है।\\nसाथियों,\\nहम पंचायतों की मदद से गांवों और शहरों के बीच की खाई को भी लगातार कम कर रहे हैं। डिजिटल क्रांति के इस दौर में अब पंचायतों को भी स्मार्ट बनाया जा रहा है। आज पंचायत स्तर पर योजनाएं बनाने से लेकर उन्हें लागू करने तक में टेक्नोल़ॉजी का भरपूर इस्तेमाल हो रहा है। जैसे आप लोग अमृत सरोवर पर इतना काम कर रहे हैं। इन अमृत सरोवरों के लिए जगह चुनने में, काम पूरा करने में हर स्तर पर टेक्नोलाजी का खूब इस्तेमाल हुआ है। आज यहां, ई-ग्राम स्\\u200dवराज – GeM इंटीग्रेटेड पोर्टल का शुभारंभ भी किया गया है। इससे पंचायतों के माध्\\u200dयम से होने वाली खरीद की प्रक्रिया, सरल और पारदर्शी बनेगी। इससे अब पंचायतों को कम कीमत में सामान मिलेगा और स्\\u200dथानीय छोटे उद्योगों को भी अपना सामान बेचने का एक सशक्त माध्यम मिल जाएगा।\\xa0 दिव्\\u200dयांगों के लिए ट्राइसिकल हो या बच्\\u200dचों की पढ़ाई से जुड़ी चीजें, पंचायतों को ये सब सामान, इस पोर्टल पर आसानी से मिलेगा।\\nभाइयों और बहनों,\\nआधुनिक टेक्नॉलॉजी का एक और लाभ, हम पीएम स्वामित्व योजना में भी देख रहे हैं। हमारे यहां गांव के घरों के प्रॉपर्टी के कागजों को लेकर बहुत उलझनें रही हैं। इसके चलते भांति-भांति के वाद विवाद होते हैं, अवैध कब्ज़ों की आशंका होती है। पीएम स्वामित्व योजना से अब ये सारी स्थितियां बदल रही हैं। आज गांव-गांव में ड्रोन टेक्नॉलॉजी से सर्वे हो रहा है, मैप बन रहे हैं। इसके आधार पर बिना किसी भेदभाव के कानूनी दस्तावेज़ लोगों\\xa0 के हाथ में सौंपे जा रहे हैं। अभी तक देशभर में 75 हजार गांवों में प्रॉपर्टी कार्ड देने का कार्य पूरा हो चुका है। और मुझे खुशी है कि मध्य प्रदेश की सरकार इसमें बहुत बेहतरीन काम कर रही है।\\nसाथियों,\\nमैं कई बार सोचता हूं कि छिंदवाड़ा के जिन लोगों पर, आपने लंबे समय तक भरोसा किया, वो आपके विकास को लेकर, इस क्षेत्र के विकास को लेकर इतना उदासीन क्यों रहे? इसका जवाब, कुछ राजनीतिक दलों की सोच में है। आजादी के बाद जिस दल ने सबसे ज्यादा समय तक सरकार चलाई, उसने ही हमारे गांवों का भरोसा तोड़ दिया। गांव में रहने वाले लोग, गांव के स्कूल, गांव की सड़कें, गांव की बिजली, गांव में भंडारण के स्थान, गांव की अर्थव्यवस्था, कांग्रेस शासन के दौरान सबको सरकारी प्राथमिकताओं में सबसे निचले पायदान पर रखा गया।\\nभाइयों और बहनों,\\nदेश की आधी से ज्यादा आबादी जिन गांवों में रहती है, उन गांवों के साथ इस तरह सौतेला व्यवहार करके देश आगे नहीं बढ़ सकता। इसलिए 2014 के बाद, जब आपने हमें सेवा का अवसर दिया, तो हम गांव की अर्थव्यवस्था को, गांव में सुविधाओं को, गांव के लोगों के हितों को सर्वोच्च प्राथमिकता में ले आए हैं। उज्ज्वला योजना के तहत जो 10 करोड़ गैस कनेक्शन मिले, वो गांव के लोगों को ही तो मिले हैं। हमारी सरकार में गरीबों के जो देशभर में पौने चार करोड़\\xa0 से भी अधिक घर बने हैं, उसमें से तीन करोड़ से अधिक घर गांव में ही तो बने हैं। और इसमें भी बड़ी बात ये है कि इन ज्यादातर घरों में मालिकाना हक, हमारी बहनों-बेटियों, माताओं का भी है। हमारे यहां एक ऐसी ट्रेडिशन चली, घर हो तो पुरुष के नाम पर, दुकान हो पुरुष के नाम पर, गाड़ी हो पुरुष के नाम पर, खेत हो पुरुष के नाम पर, महिलाओं के नाम पर कुछ होता ही नहीं था। हमने ये रिवाज बदला है और मालिकाना हक हमारी माताएं, बहनें, बेटियां बने।\\nसाथियों,\\nभाजपा की सरकार ने देश की करोड़ों महिलाओं को घर की मालकिन बनाया है। और आप जानते हैं आज के समय में पीएम आवास का हर घर लाख रुपए से भी ज्यादा कीमत का होता है। यानि भाजपा ने देश में करोड़ों दीदी को लखपति दीदी बनाया है। मैं इन सभी लखपति दीदीयों को प्रणाम करता हूं आप आशीर्वाद दीजिए कि देश में और कोटि-कोटि दीदी भी लखपति बनें इसके लए हम काम करते रहें।\\xa0 आज ही यहां चार लाख लोगों का उनके अपने पक्के घर में गृह प्रवेश हुआ है। इसमें भी बहुत बड़ी संख्या में लखपति दीदी बन गई हैं। मैं सभी को बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूं।\\nसाथियों,\\nपीएम सौभाग्य योजना के तहत जिन ढाई करोड़ घरों में बिजली पहुंची, उनमें से ज्यादातर गांव के ही घर हैं। गांव के रहने वाले मेरे भाई-बहन हैं। गांव के लोगों के लिए हमारी सरकार ने हर घर जल योजना भी शुरू की है। सिर्फ तीन-चार साल में इस योजना की वजह से देश के 9 करोड़ से अधिक ग्रामीण परिवारों को घर में नल से जल मिलने लगा है। यहां एमपी में भी गांव में रहने वाले सिर्फ 13 लाख परिवारों तक नल से जल पहुंचता था। पहले की बात करता हूं। आज एमपी के गांवों में करीब-करीब 60 लाख घरों तक नल से जल पहुंचने लगा है। और आपका ये जिला तो शत प्रतिशत हो गया है।\\nसाथियों,\\nहमारे गांव के लोगों का पहले देश के बैंकों पर अधिकार ही नहीं माना जाता था, भूला दिया गया था। गांव के ज्यादातर लोगों के पास ना बैंक खाते होते थे और ना ही उन्हें बैंकों से सुविधा मिलती थीं। बैंक खाता ना होने की वजह से, सरकार जो पैसा गरीबों के लिए भेजती थी, वो भी बीच में ही लूट जाता था। हमारी सरकार ने इसे भी पूरी तरह बदल दिया है। हमने जनधन योजना चलाकर गांव के 40 करोड़ से ज्यादा लोगों के बैंक खाते खुलवाए। हमने India Post Payments Bank के माध्यम से पोस्ट ऑफिस का उपयोग करके\\xa0 गांवों तक बैंकों की पहुंच बढ़ाई। हमने लाखों बैंक मित्र बनाए, बैंक सखियों को प्रशिक्षित किया। आज इसका प्रभाव देश के हर गांव में नजर आ रहा है। देश के गाँवों को जब बैंकों की ताकत मिली है, तो खेती-किसानी से लेकर व्यापार कारोबार तक, सब में गांव के लोगों की मदद हो रही है।\\nसाथियों,\\nपहले की सरकारों ने भारत के गांवों के साथ एक और बड़ा अन्याय किया था। पहले की सरकारें गांव के लिए पैसे खर्च करने से बचती थीं। गांव अपने आप में कोई वोटबैंक तो था ही नहीं, इसलिए उन्हें नजर-अंदाज किया जाता था। गांव के लोगों को बांटकर कई राजनीतिक दल अपनी दुकान चला रहे थे। भारतीय जनता पार्टी ने गांवों के साथ हो रहे इस अन्नाय को भी समाप्त कर दिया है। हमारी सरकार ने गांवों के विकास के लिए भी तिजोरी खोल दी। आप देखिए, हर घर जल योजना पर साढ़े तीन लाख करोड़ रुपए से ज्यादा खर्च किया जा रहा हैं। पीएम आवास योजना पर भी लाखों करोड़ रुपए खर्च किए जा रहे हैं। दशकों से अधूरी पड़ी सिंचाई परियोजनाओं को पूरा करने के लिए एक लाख करोड़ रुपए खर्च किए जा रहे हैं। पीएम ग्रामीण सड़क योजना पर भी हजारों करोड़ रुपए खर्च किए जा रहे हैं। पीएम किसान सम्मान निधि के तहत भी सरकार ने करीब-करीब ढाई लाख करोड़ रुपए सीधे किसानों के बैंक खातों में भेजे हैं। यहां एमपी के लगभग 90 लाख किसानों को भी साढ़े 18 हजार करोड़ रुपए इस योजना के तहत मिले हैं। इस निधि से रीवा के किसानों को भी\\xa0 करीब-करीब 500 करोड़ रुपए मिले हैं। हमारी सरकार ने जो MSP बढ़ाई है, उससे भी गांवों में हजारों करोड़ रुपए अतिरिक्त पहुंचे हैं। कोरोना के इस काल में पिछले तीन साल से हमारी सरकार गांव में रहने वाले गरीबों को मुफ्त राशन दे रही है। गरीब कल्याण की इस योजना पर भी 3 लाख करोड़ रुपए से अधिक खर्च किए जा रहे हैं।\\nसाथियों,\\nजब गांव में विकास के इतने काम होते हैं, जब इतना सारा पैसा खर्च होता है, तो गांव में रोजगार के अवसर भी बनते हैं। गांवों में रोजगार-स्वरोजगार को गति देने के लिए, गांव के लोगों को गांव में ही काम देने के लिए केंद्र सरकार मुद्रा योजना भी चला रही है। मुद्रा योजना के तहत लोगों को बीते वर्षों में 24 लाख करोड़ रुपए की मदद दी गई है। इससे गांवों में भी करोड़ों लोगों ने अपना रोजगार शुरु किया है। मुद्रा योजना की बहुत बड़ी लाभार्थी भी हमारी बहनें हैं, बेटियां हैं, माताएं हैं। हमारी सरकार की योजनाएं किस तरह गांव में महिला शक्तिकरण कर रही हैं, गांव में महिलाओं को आर्थिक रूप से सशक्त कर रही हैं, उसकी चर्चा आज हर तरफ है। बीते 9 साल में 9 करोड़ महिलाएं सेल्फ हेल्प ग्रुप में शामिल हुई हैं। यहां मध्य प्रदेश में भी 50 लाख से ज्यादा महिलाएं स्वयं सहायता समूहों से जुड़ी हैं। हमारी सरकार में हर स्वयं सहायता समूह को बिना बैंक गारंटी 20 लाख रुपए तक का ऋण दिया जा रहा है। कितने ही लघु उद्योगों की कमान अब महिलाएं ही संभाल रही हैं। यहां तो राज्य सरकार ने हर जिले में दीदी कैफे भी बनाया है। पिछले पंचायत चुनावों में सेल्फ हेल्प ग्रुप से जुड़ी करीब 17 हजार बहनें पंचायत प्रतिनिधी के तौर पर चुनी गयी हैं। ये अपने आप में बड़े गर्व की बात है। मैं मध्य प्रदेश की नारीशक्ति को इसके लिए फिर\\xa0 एक बार बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूं।\\nसाथियों,\\nआज यहां आजादी के अमृत महोत्सव में समावेशी विकास का अभियान भी शुरू हुआ है। ये विकसित भारत के निर्माण के लिए सबका प्रयास के भाव को सशक्त करने वाला है। विकसित भारत के लिए देश की हर पंचायत, हर संस्था का प्रतिनिधि, हर नागरिक हम सबको को जुटना होगा। ये तभी संभव है जब हर मूल सुविधा तेज़ी से शत-प्रतिशत लाभार्थी तक पहुंचे, बिना किसी भेदभाव के पहुंचे। इसमें आप सभी पंचायत प्रतिनिधियों की भूमिका बहुत बड़ी है।\\nभाइयों और बहनों,\\nपंचायतों द्वारा खेती से जुड़ी नई व्यवस्थाओं को लेकर भी जागरूकता अभियान चलाने की ज़रूरत है। प्राकृतिक खेती को लेकर आज देश में बहुत व्यापक स्तर पर काम चल रहा है। यहां भी केमिकल खेती के नुकसान के बारे में चर्चा हुई है। हमने देखा कि कैसे हमारी बेटियों ने धरती मां की तकलीफ के बारे में हम सभी को बताया। नाट्य प्रयोग करके धरती मां की वेदना हम तक पहुंचाई है। केमिकल वाली खेती से धरती मां का जो नुकसान हो रहा है, बहुत ही आसान तरीके से हमारी इन बेटियों ने सबको समझाया है। धरती की ये पुकार हम सभी को समझनी होगी। हमें हमारी मां को मारने का हक नहीं है। ये धरती हमारी मां है। उस मां को मारने का हमें अधिकार नहीं है। मेरा आग्रह है कि हमारी पंचायतें, प्राकृतिक खेती को लेकर जनजागरण अभियान चलाएं। छोटे किसान हों, पशुपालक हों, मछुआरे भाई-बहन हों, इनकी मदद के लिए जो अभियान केंद्र सरकार चला रही है, उसमें भी पंचायतों की बड़ी भागीदारी है। जब आप विकास से जुड़ी हर गतिविधि से जुड़ेंगे, तो राष्ट्र के सामूहिक प्रयासों को बल मिलेगा। यही अमृतकाल में विकसित भारत के निर्माण की ऊर्जा बनेगी।\\nसाथियों,\\nआज पंचायती राज दिवस पर, मध्य प्रदेश के विकास को नई गति देने वाली कई और परियोजनाओं का शिलान्यास औऱ लोकार्पण हुआ है। छिन्दवाड़ा-नैनपुर-मंडला फोर्ट रेल लाइन के बिजलीकरण से इस क्षेत्र के लोगों की दिल्ली-चेन्नई और हावड़ा-मुंबई तक कनेक्टिविटी और आसान हो जाएगी। इसका बड़ा लाभ हमारे आदिवासी भाई-बहनों को भी होगा। आज छिन्दवाड़ा-नैनपुर के लिए नई ट्रेनें भी शुरू हुई हैं। इन नई ट्रेनों के चलने से कई कस्बे और गांव, अपने जिला मुख्यालय छिंदवाड़ा, सिवनी से सीधे जुड़ जाएंगे।\\xa0 इन ट्रेनों की मदद से नागपुर और जबलपुर जाना भी आसान हो जाएगा। आज जो रीवा-इतवारी-छिंदवाड़ा नई ट्रेन चली है, उससे भी अब सिवनी और छिन्दवाड़ा, सीधे नागपुर से जुड़ जायेंगे। ये पूरा क्षेत्र तो अपने वन्य जीवों के लिए बहुत प्रसिद्ध है। यहां की बढ़ती हुई कनेक्टिविटी, यहां पर्यटन भी बढ़ाएगी और रोजगार के नए अवसर भी बनाएगी। इसका बड़ा लाभ यहां के किसानों को होगा, विद्यार्थियों को होगा, रेलवे के डेली पैसेंजर्स को होगा, छोटे कारोबारियों और दुकानदारों को होगा। यानि डबल इंजन की सरकार ने आज आपकी खुशियां भी डबल कर दी हैं।\\nसाथियों,\\nआज मैं आपका एक और बात के लिए आभार व्यक्त करना चाहता हूं।\\xa0 अभी शिवराज जी ने बड़े विस्तार से वर्णन किया कि इस रविवार, मन की बात के सौ एपिसोड पूरे हो रहे हैं। आप सभी के आशीर्वाद, आप सभी के स्नेह और आपके योगदान की वजह से ही मन की बात, आज इस मुकाम तक पहुंचा है। मध्य प्रदेश के अनेकों लोगों की उपलब्धियों का जिक्र मैंने मन की बात में किया है। यहां के लोगों की लाखों चिट्ठियां और संदेश भी मुझे मिलते रहे हैं। इस बार रविवार को, मन की बात में, फिर आपसे मिलने के लिए मैं भी बहुत इंतजार कर रहा हूं। क्योंकि सेंचुरी है ना। और हमारे यहां तो सेंचुरी का जरा महत्व ज्यादा ही होता है। आप हर बार की तरह रविवार को अवश्य मेरे साथ जुड़िएगा। इसी आग्रह के साथ मैं अपनी बात समाप्त करता हूं। एक बार फिर आप सभी को पंचायती राज दिवस की अनेक-अनेक शुभकामनाएं देता हूं। बहुत-बहुत धन्यवाद! भारत माता की –जय,\\nभारत माता की –जय,\\nभारत माता की –जय।\\n***\\nDS/ST/DK\\n'),\n",

During the hour long meeting with the Minister, the Chief Information Commissioner gave a brief about the progressively improving disposal rate of the RTI applications in spite of the pandemic induced disruptions in recent times. Dr Jitendra Singh lauded Central Information Commission for achieving consistent decline in pendency with corresponding rise in disposal of the Right to Information (RTI) appeals. He said, he was pleased to note that the pendency reduced from about 29,000 cases last year to around 19,000 cases at present, while the disposal of cases increased from 28,793 in 2021-22 to 29,104 in 2022-23. Sinha also informed that in the month of June 2020, in spite of COVID pandemic, the monthly disposal rate of RTI applications was higher than the rate in the corresponding month of June last year i.e. 2019. He said, this was possible because the Central Information Commission had carried on its work uninterrupted even during the COVID times by using modern technology of online, virtual and video conferences. Dr Jitendra Singh also pointed out that it was during the challenging times of pandemic in May, 2020, the Central Information Commission started entertaining, hearing and disposing of RTIs from the newly created Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir, through virtual means. He said, applicants from J&K and Ladakh were allowed to file RTI applications from home and even for appeals to the CIC. It is pertinent to mention here that consequent to the passing of J&K Reorganisation Act 2019, the J&K Right to Information Act 2009 and the Rules there under were repealed and Right to Information Act 2005 and the Rules there under were enforced from 31.10.2019. He also added that as far as J&K, the difference now is that non-Domicile or non-State subjects of Jammu & Kashmir are also entitled to file RTIs related to UT issues or agencies. Sinha also briefed Dr Jitendra Singh about the status of disposal of the RTI applications from Jammu & Kashmir ever since the Union Territory was brought under the purview of Central Information Commission earlier this year. After CIC started in J&K, In 2020-21, out of the 844 registered RTI applications, 301 were disposed. In 2021-22, 297 new RTI applications were registered and 114 were disposed. In 2022-23, 293 new RTI applications were registered and 697 were disposed including those from the backlog of the earlier years. CIC has been functioning in J&K for the last three years and as of now, only around 300 RTI applications are pending and very soon that will also be disposed, assured Sinha. He thanked the Minister for continuous support from the government and coordination by the Department of Personnel & Training (DoPT). The Union Minister also noted that it was during the Modi government that a 24 hour portal service was introduced for e-filing of the RTI applications during any part of the day or night and from any part of the country or abroad. It was during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s tenure, he said, that the office of Central Information Commissioner was shifted to its own exclusive office complex. Dr Jitendra Singh reiterated that the role of the Central Information Commission is important to live upto to Prime Minister Modi’s vision of transparency and citizen - participation in the functioning of the government. *****\\nSNC/SM\\n\"),\n",

There had been persistent demands from different States to hold SSC exams in languages other than English and Hindi. Government appointed an Expert Committee to look at this aspect too amongst other things (review of scheme and syllabus of examinations conducted by the Commission). The Expert Committee in its report had inter-alia recommended the following: “Study of posts of SSC especially Group ‘C’ post indicates that these posts are at cutting edge of Government-citizen interaction. India being a country where multiple languages are spoken, it would be in fitness of things to conduct 12th and 10th exam in multi languages.

The Minister said that the action is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision to ensure that everyone gets an equal opportunity to apply for jobs and that no one is disenfranchised or placed at a disadvantage because of a language barrier. The Minister added that the action will satisfy the long-standing requests of candidates from many states, particularly from south India, for the exams that were previously held in English and Hindi.

During the meeting, President Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe shared his vision for Sri Lanka, a strategy to address the recent economic challenges and put the country on the path of high economic growth. The discussion centered around policy reforms, good governance, digitalization, capacity building and training, institution building, and assured public service delivery. He admired the way India has managed socio-economic development and has ensured high economic growth. During the discussion, the President Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe urged NCGG to help in establishing a University of Governance and Public Policy in Sri Lanka. During the meeting, the Director General, NCGG underscored how Shri Narendra Modi, upon assuming the role of Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001 amid a slew of crises and negative economic growth, was able to put the state on the path of high economic growth and sustained prosperity through his vision, strategy, and progressive policies. Consequently, Gujarat has experienced double-digit economic growth over the past two decades. Thereafter, since 2014, as Prime Minister, he has introduced a new culture of citizen-centric policies and good governance, and as a result, India is witnessing high economic growth, assured public service delivery and fast improving quality of life of its citizens. To reinforce Prime Minister’s vision for good governance, which focuses on transparency, accountability, and inclusiveness, India is massively using digital technology and planning, execution and monitoring mechanism for time-bound implementation. In line with the Prime Minister’s philosophy of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ NCGG in partnership with the Ministry of External Affairs, is dedicated to promoting collaboration and learning among civil servants of India and neighbouring countries. During the discussion, Sri Lankan President requested that the NCGG extend the necessary help to Sri Lanka based on India’s experience of digital governance and participatory policymaking to ensure faster socio-economic development and high economic growth. The Indian delegation met several senior civil servants of Sri Lanka, and everyone is keen to know how Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given a new governance model to eradicate poverty, ensure high-quality services, assured public service delivery, environmental protection, inclusion & equity, transparency and accountability, and high economic growth. Sri Lanka is keen to learn policy–driven governance model of India and the massive use of digital technology in the planning, execution, and monitoring of various programmes and projects. During a series of meeting set up by the President’s office, top civil servants expressed their appreciation for the sustained assistance that India has provided to Sri Lanka during its recent unprecedented economic crisis. DG spoke about Prime Minister’s mantra of ‘neighbourhood first’ and highlighted special relationship India – Sri Lanka have. The DG also stressed the critical role of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership and vision, as well as his emphasis on good governance, in ensuring efficient, effective, and technology-driven public service delivery. The discussions centred on the NCGG's support for Sri Lanka in policy reforms, utilization of digital technology, capacity building, good governance, and institution building. They believed that this would aid Sri Lanka in strengthening its institutions and that the country is eager to learn and utilize India's successful governance model to achieve high economic growth. The Indian delegation emphasized the positive impact of digital technology in promoting transparency, equity, inclusion, and accountability. The automation of processes has eliminated the need for physical interactions between individuals and officers, effectively reducing opportunities for corrupt practices. The Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) is a prime example of how process automation can bring speed and scale to development schemes. By directly transferring cash benefits to beneficiaries' Jan Dhan Yojana bank accounts, the program eliminated the role of middlemen and, consequently, opportunities for corrupt practices. The DBT was powered by the 'JAM Trinity' of Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile. The unique digital ID, Aadhaar, provided to each citizen streamlined the identification of genuine beneficiaries and eliminated ghost beneficiaries. Digitalization has made a significant difference in the implementation of various developmental programs and the provision of public services, as evidenced by the recent growth in both direct and indirect taxes. The DG also provided an example of the robust e-monitoring system of the Jal Jeevan Mission on the dashboard, which uses sensor-based IoT devices.The National Centre for Good Governance was set up in 2014 by the Government of India as an apex–level autonomous institution to focus on good governance, policy reforms, training, and capacity building of civil servants of the country as well as of other developing countries. NCGG also works as a think tank. It has taken up capacity building of civil servants of several developing countries in partnership with the Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India.

These officers are the ones who have the opportunity to devote the next 25 years with full energy and capability to the making of India at 2047, he said. Addressing the inaugural session of 16th Civil Services Day at Vigyan Bhawan here, Dr Jitendra Singh said that the officers who are in the age group of 30s should be our main focus for capacity building as they have another 25 years to put in, before India celebrates its 100 years of independence and they are the ones blessed with the privilege to be the architects of India at 2047. Our responsibility today will be to contribute to the capacity building of this group of officers, he said. If we are able to do that effectively, we will be doing justice to India at 2047, he added. Dr Jitendra Singh said that the 16th Civil Services Day events commencing today reflect the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi outlined by him from the ramparts of Red Fort in his Independence Day address when he gave a clarion call as the nation stepped into \"Amrit Kaal\". The theme for the 2-day Civil Services Day 2023 is titled \"Viksit Bharat: Empowering Citizens and Reaching the Last Mile\". The saturation approach envisaged in implementation of Priority Programs in the Amrit Kaal period can only be achieved when the Nation’s civil service pursues this objective with a seriousness of purpose, steely determination and a deep sense of commitment to the national cause, said the Minister. Quoting Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s address to the very first group of civil servants in 1948 that “Your predecessors were brought up in the traditions in which they … kept themselves aloof from the common run of the people. It will be your bounden duty to treat the common men in India as your own”, the Minister said that much has changed with the passage of time. Dr Jitendra Singh said that soon after this government came to power, the Prime Minister gave us the mantra ‘Maximum governance, Minimum Government’. In a simple sentence, it means a Government which is a facilitator, not an intimidator. When we talk of a government like this it means increased transparency, increased accountability and most of all increased citizen participation, he added. The Minister said that Citizen participation has already happened and one of the most striking examples of it is the SVAMITVA scheme. It is a reformative step towards establishment of clear ownership of property in rural inhabited (Abadi) areas, by mapping of land parcels using drone technology and providing ‘Record of Rights’ to village household owners with issuance of legal ownership cards (Property cards/Title deeds) to the property owners. Another hallmark is the grievance redressal. One of the benchmarks of transparency and accountability is the grievance redressal mechanism, said Dr Jitendra Singh. When we introduced CPGRAMS, in 2014 we just had about 2 lakh grievances being filed across the country every year, today we have about 20 lakhs, 10 times more. This is the result of increased trust of people in grievance redressal. We were prompt, worked very hard and we ensured 95-100% disposal every week. Now we have institutionalised a mechanism wherein after the redressal of complaint, one of our officers calls up the complainant to find out the level of satisfaction, he added. Dr Jitendra Singh said that similarly, Mission Karmayogi is also a pathbreaking reform because if you want to have last mile delivery, you have to be competent for that. So Mission Karmayogi is one of the novel experiments whereby any officer taking up new assignment, would be able to build inherent capacity within themselves for the new assignment. Overnight you can prepare for the next assignment. We have used technology and transparency to bring out the efficiency of the officer. The credit goes entirely to Prime Minister Modi, he said. The Minister said that the Aspirational district was another experiment of similar nature where the government decided the indices on a scientific basis.'),\n",

Moreover, Dr Jitendra Singh said, when covid struck, the work in this Ministry did not get affected even for a single day, rather the output sometimes was even more. In CIC, in one single month of June 2020 when India was facing the height of the pandemic, the disposal of RTI applications was higher than the corresponding month of June 2019 in the non-covid times due to prompt online functioning, he said. Talking about digital transformation, the Minister said that e-Office version 7.0 has been adopted in all 75 Ministries/ Departments of Central Secretariat by end February 2023. This is a commendable achievement that 89.6 percent of all files are processed as e-files in the Central Secretariat. Dr Jitendra Singh also mentioned that the Prime Minister Modi is a man of several innovations in governance and the Chintan Shivir laid down a futuristic model of governance representing far-reaching administrative reforms in the Amrit Kaal period. The Chintan Shivir represents an administrative best practice where de-siloization and free exchange of views has been possible. Team building exercises breaking vertical silos conceptualised in Chintan Shivir with an average duration of 48 – 72 hours. The Minister urged each of the Ministries to conduct Chintan Shivir to transform institutional dynamics suited to 21st century governance models. The Minister said that the Prime Minister Modi would be addressing the nation on Civil Services Day, April 21 2023 and conferring the Prime Minister’s Awards for Excellence in Public Administration. The Prime Minister has devoted considerable time and energy to personally restructure the scheme to ensure that high meritocracy is rewarded, evaluation processes are robust and participation is inclusive. 15 Awardees from 2520 nominations would be receiving the awards tomorrow. The Minister congratulated all the awardees. He further said that he is pleased to note that the overall efforts and nominations received are commendable, with 97% of districts registering for the PM Awards for Excellence in 2022. Dr Jitendra Singh concluded by appreciating the efforts of DARPG in ensuring a fair and transparent selection process for the awards. It is essential for civil servants to embrace innovation and technology to improve public service delivery and governance. The rigorous evaluation process involves multiple rounds of scrutiny, including on-site visits to the nominated organisations. After the evaluation process, a shortlist of candidates is sent to the Prime Minister's Office for final selection, he added. The Vice-President of India, Shri Jagdeep Dhankhar unveiled an e-book on ‘National Good Governance Webinar Series’ during the event. He also inaugurated an exhibition on ‘Good Governance Practices in India- Awarded Initiatives’. Shri Rajiv Gauba, Cabinet Secretary, Shri Sunil Kumar Gupta, Secretary to the Vice-President of India, Shri V. Srinivas, Secretary, Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances and other senior officers of the Government of India were also present in large numbers on the occasion. *****\\nSNC/SM\\n\"),\n",

In addition, PRI representatives comprising mainly Sarpanches and Panches from other districts including Kathua were also connected online. Dr Jitendra Singh interacted individually with each of the PRI representatives and party members in two groups in two separate sessions respectively lasting one and half hour each for a total period of over three hours. This is part of the recent cycle initiated by him wherein as an MP, he physically visits one district of his constituency every week and tries to connect online with the other district where he is not physically visiting that particular week. To begin with, the Union Minister provided them with an update about some of the latest information regarding the constituency and the new development works approved recently. Dr Jitendra Singh advised the PRI representatives to listen to the 100th edition of Mann Ki Baat broadcast by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 30th April. He said, the programme could be given the format of a community listening where a large number of people sit together and observe the occasion as a festival. He said the 100th edition of Mann Ki Baat also deserves celebration because it has been totally a non-political broadcast by the Head of the government and is dedicated to development works in different parts of the country and welfare schemes reaching different sections of society. Also this is for the first time and a record in itself that any Head of Government has consistently every month, without fail, interacted with his audience without a single interruption, he added. As far as the developmental works are concerned, Dr Jitendra Singh informed the representatives that the vital Chattergalla Tunnel has been approved for construction under Bharatmala scheme and is awaiting final approval. He said, once the tunnel is ready, it will provide an all-weather new National highway from Lakhanpur on the Punjab border upto Doda district of Jammu and Kashmir via Basohli-Bani. This will be a gamechanger by generating revenue and employment facilities besides attracting tourists, he said. The PRI representatives also gave inputs regarding the PMGSY roads to be included in the coming year. Dr Jitendra Singh told them that instructions have been issued that the preference regarding which road is to be constructed under PMGSY scheme will be given to Panches, Sarpanches, DDC members and other local body representatives without any interference from the MP’s side and therefore they should furnish the list of their preferred roads to the concerned authorities at the earliest. The issue of delay in the work of Juthana village in Kathua also came up for discussion. Dr Jitendra Singh informed that he had already taken up the issue with the UT authorities and Principal Secretary Shailendra Kumar Singh was personally following up the matter to resolve some of the pending issues at the earliest in order to resume the construction work and complete it on a fast track . About the proposed Kendriya Vidyalaya in Billawar, the Minister, on the spot, fixed a meeting of the public representatives with the Deputy Commissioner Kathua for tomorrow so that the process could be expedited. There were issues related to ration cards etc. for which the Minister advised Divisional Commissioner Jammu, Ramesh Kumar to hold a meeting tomorrow itself with the local body representatives and provide an update. *****\\nSNC/SM\\n'),\n",

Speaking as Chief Guest after presenting Yashraj Bharati Samman (YBS) Awards at a ‘Gratitude ceremony’ organised by the Yashraj Research Foundation (YRF) here, Dr Jitendra Singh said that unlike the earlier governments which found comfort in status quoist approach, Prime Minister Modi has demonstrated the courage and conviction to do away with such rules which were causing inconvenience for the citizens and many of which that had persisted since the time of British Raj. The ultimate aim of good governance is to bring ease of living to the citizens, he added. The Minister appreciated Yashraj Research Foundation (YRF) for instituting the Yashraj Bharti Samman (YBS) and recognising the exemplary work done by different individuals and organisations in different fields. He further said that the three categories in which the awards have been presented, namely innovation in healthcare, transforming people’s lives and ethical governance, have always been the priority of the Government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Minister recalled that soon after the Government came to power in May 2014, within two to three months, the practice of getting certificates attested by gazetted officers was done away with. Thereafter within a year, Prime Minister spoke from the ramparts of Red Fort about the abolition of interview in job recruitment so that a level playing field could be provided. In pension, face recognition technology was introduced so that the elder citizens did not have to go through the tedious process of getting a life certificate. Most of the functioning was converted online and in order to bring in transparency, accountability and citizen participation, the human interface was reduced to the bare minimum. Talking about grievance redressal, Dr. Jitendra Singh said that the grievance redressal mechanism was shifted to CPGRAMS as a result of which about 20 lakh grievances are received every year in comparison to just 2 lakhs every year before this government came in because this government followed a policy of time bound redressal and gained the confidence of the people. In the field of healthcare, the Minister said that use of technology and telemedicine during Covid pandemic has shown how innovation can deliver healthcare in the remote and rural areas. This Government has not only promoted technology and innovation but also StartUps to undertake new innovations even in the health sector thereby transforming lives of citizens. Dr Jitendra Singh concluded that earlier our priorities were misplaced and for seventy years it continued to be misplaced because we were being governed by status quoist governments. But for the first time in 9 years, there is sought to be undone what should have been undone in all these years. He expressed happiness in Yashraj Research Foundation’s (YRF) efforts to carry forward the Prime Minister’s message to every household in the country. <><><><><>\\nSNC/SM\\n'),\n",

Addressing a congregation of First-time Voters at Hasanpur Assembly constituency, Amroha district, Uttar Pradesh, Dr Jitendra Singh said that as these new young voters are getting the opportunity to exercise their franchise, they will be voting for the Modi led dispensation in an India which is full of optimism and upward journey. He said that this is something quite in contrast to the plight the earlier two generations of youth after independence went through, when there was an atmosphere of pessimism and lack of esteem. Many of the youth went aboard during this time as they were not able to find any future hope for themselves by staying back in the country, the Minister remarked. Dr Jitendra Singh said that whereas now the trend has shifted. Not only the Indian youth are looked up with esteem but the youth who have gone out of India are looking to come back and explore the opportunities in front of them. The Minister mentioned that those who vote for the first-time now will have the opportunity to become key voters and opinion makers of the Indian society at a time when India celebrates 100 years of independence 25 years from now as they would be at the prime of their age. Quoting Prime Minister when he said at a Youth Convocation Ceremony that \"The whole world is looking at India\\'s youth with hope. Because you are the growth engine of the country and India is the world\\'s growth engine”, Dr Jitendra Singh said, the New India is open, futuristic and known for its progressive views and the development of our country is on the shoulders of the youth. While highlighting the various schemes and initiatives of the Government over the past 8 years, Dr Jitendra Singh said that firstly all these schemes are youth centric and secondly they all took care to provide level playing field to all youth whether it was introducing the practise of self-attestation and ending the practise of attestation through gazetted officers or whether it was abolition of interview so that there was no room for any misappropriation in the job recruitments. Dr Jitendra Singh gave full credit to the futuristic vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi who had given a call for \"Start-Up India Stand Up India\" from the ramparts of Red Fort in his Independence Day address of 2015 that initiated a mass interest, as a result of which the number of Start-Ups in India has increased from mere 350 in 2014 to over 80,000 in 2022 with 85 unicorns (with the $1 billion valuation and above). This has tremendously widened the avenues for the youth. Dr Jitendra Singh said that the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a futuristic vision and that is the reason he has given a special focus to the new generation which is coming up in India. *****\\nSNC/SM\\n'),\n",

Speaking as chief guest at the Youth 20 Consultation on Peace-building and Reconciliation: Ushering in an Era of No War at the University of Jammu, Dr Jitendra Singh said three generations have passed since Independence and there was no dearth of talent or capabilities but the favourable milieu was lacking which has now been made available by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. So this is a great opportunity but at the same time also a challenge and privilege because the same youth will be deciding the face of India@2047. Those who are thirty today will be the prime citizens, he said. Dr Jitendra Singh said that 2023 is a very important year for the country as India is holding the G20 presidency. In this auspicious year, one can reasonably say that Prime Minister Modi has given a model of governance which is sustainable, which defies the principle of diminishing returns and which grows stronger with each new challenge. Therefore the point to ponder in the context of today’s meeting is what is the inter-relationship between the Modi governance of 2023 and the youth of 2023. The Minister said that just after forming the Government in May 2014, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi had said that this Government will be dedicated towards the upliftment of the poor, empowerment of women and the betterment of the youth. Before 2014, the environment in the country was one of desperation and hopelessness. He added that on the evening of 26th May 2014 when Narendra Modi was sworn in as Prime Minister, I said this is the beginning of the journey from pessimism to optimism. So when the Prime Minister said that his government would give high priority to youth, many people treated it with cynicism. But today when you look back, as the government is completing 9 years under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, you can reasonably say with evidence that Modi has walked the talk and also led his team to walk the talk. The Minister recalled that soon after the Government came to power in May 2014, within two to three months, the practice of getting certificates attested by gazetted officers was done away with. Thereafter within a year, Prime Minister spoke from the ramparts of Red Fort about the abolition of interview in job recruitment so that a level playing field could be provided. In pension, face recognition technology was introduced so that the elderly citizens did not have to go through the tedious process of getting a life certificate. Most of the functioning was converted online and in order to bring in transparency, accountability and citizen participation, the human interface was reduced to the bare minimum. This highlights the fact that now there is a government that is ready to trust the youth of this country. Talking about grievance redressal, Dr. Jitendra Singh said that the grievance redressal mechanism was shifted to CPGRAMS as a result of which about 20 lakh grievances are received every year in comparison to just 2 lakhs every year before this government came in because this government followed a policy of time bound redressal and gained the confidence of the people. It was Prime Minister Modi, said Dr Jitendra Singh, who had, a few months ago, promised the nation that he would soon provide 10 lakh government jobs for the youth. Once again, the Minister said, it is evident that Prime Minister Modi does what he says and he has the capacity to make everything “Mumkin” (possible). Dr Jitendra Singh said, right from the beginning, Prime Minister Modi has given highest priority to the issues and concerns related to youth. He said, Prime Minister has constantly sought to create new avenues and opportunities for livelihood, government jobs and income for the youth. Dr Jitendra Singh referred to the India’s Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, which the Modi government amended after 30 years in 2018 to introduce a number of new provisions including criminalising the act of giving bribe also in addition to taking bribe and at the same time putting in place an effective deterrence for such actions by individuals as well as corporate entities. Dr Jitendra Singh recalled that it was Prime Minister Modi who, in his Independence Day address of 2015, gave a call for “StartUp India StandUp India”, which soon turned into a countrywide movement. The result of this is that now the number of StartUps in India has gone up from 300 to 400 in 2014 to more than 75,000 today and India ranks third in the world in StartUp ecosystem, he added. Moreover the number of Biotech StartUps in the country has increased from 50 to over 5,000 in the last 8 years, because of the support and enabling milieu provided by Prime Minister NarendraModi ever since he took over in 2014. It is expected to cross the figure of 10,000 by 2025. Bio economy before 2014 was just $10 billion, today it is $80 billion and the target is $100 billion by 2025, he added. The Minister said that Himalayan states including Uttarakhand have become the fountainhead for aromatic start-ups. Moreover he said that “Purple Revolution” or Aroma Mission is Jammu & Kashmir’s contribution to \"StartUps India. Pertinent to mention that Aroma Mission is attracting StartUps and agriculturists from across the country. More than 44,000 persons have been trained and several crores of farmers\\' revenue generated. Similarly Dr. Jitendra Singh said, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given the highest priority to the growth and development of the North Eastern region and it was a path-breaking decision under his leadership to exempt home grown bamboo from the purview of the 100 year old Indian Forest Act. This helped in bringing ease of doing business in the bamboo sector for the young entrepreneurs, he said. Earlier governments never cared to explore India\\'s vast ocean resources and it is for the first time, after Shri Narendra Modi took over as Prime Minister that there is a serious effort to explore and harness the ocean resources and give priority to the Blue Economy of India\\nIn the field of conventional education, at the start of 2014, there were 725 universities and now 300 more have been added in the past 9 years at the rate of 1 new university every week. The Minister said that 145 medical colleges were opened in the country between 2004 and 2014. More than 260 medical colleges have been opened during 2014 to 2022 at the rate of 1 college of medicine per day and at the rate of 2 degree colleges per day so that every youth get accessibility to education. He/she should not be deprived of receiving education simply because it’s not available, he added. The Minister recalled that recently Central University of Jammu has opened North India’s first teaching department of space. Saying that one of the objectives of NEP-2020 is de-linking degree from education, Dr.Jitendra Singh said that linking degrees with education has taken a heavy toll on our education system and society as well. One of the fall-outs has been an increasing number of educated unemployed. Dr Jitendra Singh mentioned that we are already a part of the global world whether we like it or not. And therefore if we have to live up to global benchmarks, we have to prepare ourselves for global challenges and we have to also address the global concerns be it climate change, clean energy etc. Prime Minister Modi, in his Independence day speech, had introduced us to the potential of green hydrogen as a fuel. India in the near future will be one of the major exporters of green hydrogen. The Minister said that Youth20 is one of the eight official engagement groups under the G20 umbrella. It is an attempt to create a connecting point between G20 governments and their local youth. The Y20 India Summit in 2023 will exemplify India’s youth-centric efforts and provide an opportunity to showcase its values and policy measures to the youth across the globe. The Minister concluded by saying that because of all this, the onus lies on the youth of today, those who are in their thirties and who are going to be the prime citizens in 2047. How best they can use this opportunity depends on them. He said he hoped that the youth at that time will be able to say that “I’m the architect of India@100” and therefore we of the earlier generation have the responsibility to induce that capacity building of the youth of today, he concluded. *****\\nSNC/SM\\n'),\n",

Presiding over a meeting of Panchayati Raj Institution representatives from Amroha District in Uttar Pradesh, Dr Jitendra Singh said that they can be the most important messengers of Prime Minister Modi’s people centric initiatives and programmes as they are directly in touch with the grassroot people. He said panchayats are continuously being empowered under Modi. The Minister further pointed out that the PRIs being elected representatives, know who are the most needy among the lowest strata of the society and can ensure that the benefits reach them without any vote bank consideration. Dr Jitendra Singh quoted Modi as saying, “The country has made this resolve to cover 100 per cent of the beneficiaries. When there is 100 percent coverage of schemes, the appeasement politics come to an end. There remains no space for it”. Dr Jitendra Singh emphasised that Modi symbolises grassroot level democracy which is liberated from any dynasty politics as he himself has risen from the grassroots. He has always insisted on the strengthening of Panchayati Raj Institutions and decentralising powers with the efficient utilisation of the central funds by discretion of the PRI representatives. The Minister further added that the Prime Minister’s faith in Panchayati Raj Institutions and grassroot level democracy is evident from the fact that after 70 years, it was due to his intervention that for the first time, Jammu and Kashmir district development council (DDC) elections were held. Dr Jitendra Singh emphasised the need for time-bound completion of development programmes and underlined the need for adoption of newer technologies and innovations for faster completion of projects without compromising with any quality. Dr Jitendra Singh said, when Modi took over in May, 2014, almost half of the country's population was deprived of facilities like toilets, housing, vaccination, electricity connection and bank accounts. He said, with ‘Sabka Prayas’, the Centre has been able to bring many schemes closer to 100% saturation during the last 8 years. There is a new resolve to make India a frontline state in the world in the next 25 years of Amrit Kaal. Dr Jitendra Singh appreciated the efforts of the PRI representatives for strengthening grass root level democracy and making people aware about the benefits of the Government’s welfare schemes. He said to PRIs that they should always keep in mind Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for maximising the reach and utilisation of government schemes in rural India so that no one is left out. He said, the Modi Government has reiterated on many occasions that there would be no shortage of funds for any of the central schemes. *****\\nSNC/SM\\n\"),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Cabinet_approves_revised_domestic_gas_pr.txt', 'Ministry': 'Ministry_of_Petroleum_Natural_Gas', 'Month': 'Apr23html'}, page_content=\"Cabinet approves revised domestic gas pricing guidelines\\n\\n\\nThe Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the revised domestic natural gas pricing guidelines for gas produced from nomination fields of ONGC/OIL, New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) blocks and pre-NELP blocks, where Production Sharing Contract (PSC) provides for Government's approval of prices. The price of such natural gas shall be 10% of the monthly average of Indian Crude Basket and shall be notified on a monthly basis. For the gas produced by ONGC & OIL from their nomination blocks, the Administered Price \\xa0Mechanism (APM) price shall be subject to a floor and a ceiling. Gas produced from new wells or well interventions in the nomination fields of ONGC & OIL, would be allowed a premium of 20% over the APM price. A detailed notification is being separately issued. The new guidelines are intended to ensure stable pricing regime for domestic gas consumers while at the same time providing adequate protection to producers from adverse market fluctuation with incentives for enhancing production. Government has targeted to increase the share of natural gas in primary energy mix in India from current 6.5% to 15% by 2030. The reforms shall help expand the consumption of natural gas and will contribute to achievement of target of emission reduction and net zero. These reforms are a continuation of the various initiatives taken by Government of India to protect the interests of consumers by reducing the impact of increase in international gas prices on gas prices in India by significantly increasing the domestic gas allocation to City Gas Distribution sector. The reforms will lead to significant decrease in prices of Piped Natural Gas (PNG) for households and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) for transport. The reduced prices shall also lower the fertilizer subsidy burden and help the domestic power sector. With the provision of a floor in gas prices as well as provision for 20% premium for new wells, this reform will incentivize ONGC and OIL to make additional long term investments in the upstream sector leading to greater production of natural gas and consequent reduction in import dependence of fossil fuels. The revised pricing guidelines will also promote lower carbon footprint through the growth of gas-based economy. Currently, the domestic gas prices are determined as per the new Domestic Gas Pricing Guidelines, 2014 which were approved by Government in 2014. The 2014 pricing guidelines provided for declaration for domestic gas prices for a 6 month period based on the volume weighted prices prevailing at four gas trading hubs - Henry Hub, Albena, National Balancing Point (UK), and Russia for a period of 12 months and a time lag of a quarter. As the earlier guidelines based on 4 gas hubs had a significant time lag and very high volatility, the need for this rationalization and reform was felt. The revised guidelines make prices linked to crude, which is a practice now followed in most industry contracts, is more relevant to our consumption basket and has deeper liquidity in global trading markets, on a real time basis. With the changes now approved, data of Indian Crude basket price from the previous month would form the basis for APM gas price determination. ***\\nDS\\n\"),\n",

The Minister said that the production of CBG would have multiple benefits viz. reduction of natural gas imports, reduction of GHG emission, reduction in burning of agriculture residues, providing remunerative income to farmers, employment generation, effective waste management etc adding, “Government of India has set a target to increase the share of gas in the energy mix up to 15% in 2030 to make India a Gas-based economy. Presently we are importing around 50% of our requirement of Natural gas. Speedy expansion of CBG will help in meeting our additional requirement from domestic resources.”\\n\\nPolicies of the Government has enabled the adoption of green renewable energy in the last 10 years. Shri Hardeep Singh Puri especially mentioned about the Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) Scheme and the use of agro-waste to generate compressed biogas. He said, “Under SATAT initiative various waste streams such as animal dung, agricultural residues, MSW (Municipal Solid Waste), sewage water and industrial wastes such as press mud, spent wash from sugar industry, food processing industry etc. is being looked into as feedstock for production of Biogas/CBG.”\\nThe Minister also shared India’s ambitious target to set up 5,000 commercial plants by 2024- 25 and produce 15 MMT of CBG which would replace other gaseous fuels being used in the country. He mentioned that India had commissioned 46 compressed biogas plants under SATAT Scheme and there were 100 outlets currently dispensing the compressed biogas across the country. Talking about the ecosystem, Shri Hardeep Singh Puri emphasised that present Government has been persistent in developing a conducive ecosystem in order to promote sustainability for all actors of the Triple Bottom Line (environment, society and economy). He indicates how the Government has formulated policies, developed schemes providing support through Central Financial Assistance, etc to support the adoption of green energy in any form. He also mentioned that the Government is engaging with other departments and ministries to simplify the regulations further, resulting in easier adoption and implementation of projects. He mentioned about Department of Fertilizers, which issued letter to Fertilizer companies for mandatory offtake of FOM with chemical fertilizers as a \"Basket approach\" and Central Pollution Control Board that included plants under \\'white category\\' status on case-to-case basis. While mentioning the importance of green and clean energy, the Minister stressed the need for generating renewable, sustainable and indigenous energy sources that can supplement other conventional energy sources in the short term and take over as the primary source of energy in long run. In addition, the Hon’ble Minister highlighted how Fermented Organic Manure (FOM), a by product of the CBG manufacturing process, might be applied in the agricultural sector to encourage organic farming and lower the usage of artificial fertilisers. While talking about the financing of projects, he indicated that Amrit Kaal Budget 2023 gives a huge boost to India\\'s Bio-Gas and clean energy revolution:\\n· With special attention given to CBG projects and announced establishment of 200 CBG projects under the umbrella of GOBARdhan scheme,\\n· Five per cent CBG mandate will be introduced for all organizations marketing natural and bio gas. · To avoid cascading of taxes on blended compressed natural gas, excise duty on the amount of GST paid on compressed biogas contained in the blended CNG has been exempted. Stressing about the inclusive growth approach of the Government, Minister said agriculture & farmers are integral part of it, which will benefit directly through more & more penetration of green energy, particularly Compressed Biogas, through the use of agricultural and animal waste largely available in the rural India. He appreciated various States and their role in promoting the adoption of green energy and particularly the Compressed Biogas and congratulated the organisers for taking a step to further promote Compressed Biogas, which will play an important role in boosting the country\\'s energy basket and strengthening India\\'s energy security in the long run. ****\\nRJ\\n'),\n",

Singh, Union Power & NRE Minister\\n\\n\\nThe Hon’ble Prime Minister on 5th January, 2015 launched Street Lighting National Programme (SLNP), which is being implemented by Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), a joint venture company of Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) of Ministry of Power to replace conventional Street Lights with smart and energy efficient LED Street Lights across India. The programme is being implemented across the country. Street Light National Programme (SLNP) is a voluntary programme. Under the programme, EESL had set an objective of converting an estimated number of 1.34 crores existing conventional Street Lights across all Urban Local Bodies (ULBs)/Gram Panchayats (GPs) of the country with energy efficient LED Street Lights in 5 years. For the same, EESL enters into agreement with ULBs/GPs directly or through the concerned State/UT Governments before replacement of Street Lights is taken up by EESL. Being a voluntary programme, no specific targets have been set for SLNP. Till date, EESL has installed more than 1.28 Cr. LED Street Lights across 29 States/UTs\\nThis information was given by the Union Minister of Power Sh. R.K.'),\n",

As per the revised mechanism, the Merit Order for cheapest generating resources across the country to meet the system demand, would be, finalized a day in advance as against 1.5 hours in the existing system. This will result in better planning for generating units and cost optimization. Moreover, the revised mechanism will also enlarge the scope of present mechanism by including all the regional entity thermal power plants and subsequently all the intra-state thermal generators. In the existing system, only the NTPC thermal stations were part of the merit order despatch. The existing mechanism of merit order dispatch at real time was made operational in April 2019. This optimised the total variable cost of generation pan-India, while meeting technical and grid security constraints. The existing mechanism resulted in reduction of variable cost on pan-India basis to the tune of ₹ 2300 Crore and these benefits were being shared with generators and their beneficiaries ultimately reducing the cost of electricity to consumers. The gains out of the proposed Day-Ahead National Merit Order Dispatch Mechanism would be shared between generating stations and their consumers. This will\\xa0 result in increased annual savings for the electricity consumers. This will also help the States in maintaining resource adequacy in a cost effective\\xa0 manner with less carbon footprints. The Day-Ahead National Merit Order Dispatch Mechanism will be implemented by CERC\\xa0 through necessary\\xa0 regulatory process and it will be operated by GRID –INDIA at national level. Since, 2014, the government has added 184.6 GW of additional generation capacity and 1,78,000 ckt kms of transmission line to connect the whole country into one grid, which has transformed the whole country into one integrated electrical system. The Ministry of Power has been taking several measures to enhance the competition in the sector with the objective of lowering the cost of electricity to consumers. *****\\nAM/\\n'),\n",

The IIRS carried out the study in nine (09) NHPC power stations/ projects which includes Subansiri Lower in Arunachal Pradesh, Teesta-V & Rangit in Sikkim, Salal, Dulhasti & Uri-II in J&K, Chamera-I & Parbat-II in Himachal Pradesh and Dhauliganga in Uttarakhand. The study undertook preparation of Landslide Inventory maps 10 years before the start of construction of the project upto the current status of the project/ power station. The report highlights that in most of the cases, landslide area decreased considerably in comparison to the landslide area observed before construction of the project. The study revealed that landslide activities around hydropower projects are not related to the construction activity of the project and the topography, geological conditions and rainfall have been found to be the major causative/ triggering factors of landslide activities. According to the report, it appears from the temporal statistics that in most of the cases, the construction of hydropower projects and related activities and post commissioning hydrological condition might have helped in stabilizing the area. Further, the size of hydropower projects, size of reservoir, local geology, soil and land cover conditions (especially vegetation cover) seems to play some slope stabilization role for mitigating landslides in the project areas. report has been prepared with help of satellite image-based interpretation, subject to resolution and availability of satellite image. ****\\nAM\\n'),\n",

Recognizing the cash flow problems arising out of outstanding receivables of Generating Companies from DISCOMs and in order to increase basic payment discipline in the power sector value chain, sustenance of which has been matter of concern due to increasing receivables to GENCOs, Government of India promulgated Electricity (Late Payment Surcharge and Related Matters) Rules, 2022 on 03.06.2022. These rules entail obligations upon the DISOCMs to clear their legacy dues as existing on 03.06.2022 in a time bound phased manner in equated monthly installments with benefits of non-applicability of late payment surcharge after 03.06.2022. These Rules also provide framework for time bound clearance of current dues through establishment of a Payment Security Mechanism and disincentives of progressive withdrawal of open access as well as power regulations if the provisions of the Rules are not followed. DISCOMs can avail loans from PFC Ltd. and REC Ltd. to clear their dues to Generating Companies. With the implementation of Electricity (LPS and Related Matters) Rules, 2022, remarkable improvement has been seen in recovery of outstanding dues. Against legacy dues of Rs.1,38,378 crores as on 03.06.2022, 13 States/ UTs have timely paid installment of Rs.47,317 crores (8 EMIs).

The project to support NTPC’s decarbonization efforts, create job opportunities and promote the use of locally available resources\\nNTPC, the largest power-generating utility in India, and Chempolis India, a Fortum group associate company and a leading Finnish bio-refining technology provider, have signed a\\xa0 Memorandum of Understanding to explore the feasibility of setting up a Bamboo-based Bio-Refinery in Bongaigaon. Chempolis will work with NTPC to conduct the feasibility study for the project which shall utilize bamboo for the production of 2G Ethanol, Bio-Coal for thermal power plant & other value-added products. The MoU was signed in presence of NTPC Director-HR Mr Dilip Kumar Patel, EIL Director-HR Mr Ashok Kumar Kalra & Chempolis President & CEO Mr Markus Alholm last week. The proposed Bio-Refinery is planned as an integration project with NTPC Bongaigaon Power Plant, where all utility requirements such as steam, power, etc., shall be supplied from the power plant and the Bio-Coal produced by the Bio-Refinery shall partly replace coal in the power plant, effectively converting 5% of the generation of the power plant to green. The project will support NTPC’s decarbonization efforts, create job opportunities and build a sustainable model by promoting the use of locally available resources.

The passenger EVs will be leased to Blusmart Mobility Pvt. Ltd (BMPL) to expand its fleet of ride-hailing cabs. The first tranche of the loan has been disbursed, and the first lot of EV cabs has hit the roads of Delhi. The cabs were flagged off by Shri Ajay Tewari, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Power and Shri Ravinder Singh Dhillon, CMD, PFC at a function yesterday. Rajiv Ranjan Jha, Director (Projects), Shri Manoj Sharma, Director (Commercial), Smt. Simmi R. Nakra, CVO and Shri Anmol Singh Jaggi (CEO and co-founder, Blusmart Mobility) and other Senior Officers were present on the occasion. Addressing on the occasion of flagging off the first lot of EVs, Shri Ravinder Singh Dhillon, CMD, PFC said, “E-mobility adoption is going on at a fast pace in the country, and we believe that there is a huge potential in this field. Through this funding, PFC has endeavoured to contribute towards India’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) goals, and this will go a long way for moving towards a healthy and sustainable mode of transport.”\\nThe 5000 passenger e4Ws (Electric Four-Wheelers) funded by PFC are being deployed in Delhi and would result in emission savings of over 1,00,000 tons of CO2 equivalent. This is equivalent to the amount of CO2 absorbed by over 5 million fully-grown trees in a year. With a vision of accelerating India’s net-zero goal, PFC, apart from funding renewables in a big way, has been exploring opportunities in debt funding of EVs (OEMs and fleet acquisition), Battery OEMs and EV charging infrastructure. *****\\nAM/\\n'),\n",

Singh\\n\\n\\nUnder Prime Minister’s ‘Gati Shakti Master Plan’, the power transmission network is planned to be expanded from 4,25,500 circuit kilometer (existing as on 31.05.2020) to 4,54,200 circuit kilometer (ckm) by 2024-25 resulting in addition of nearly 28,700 ckm. This addition has been proposed in the Inter State Transmission system (ISTS) network at 220kV and above voltage level. Based on the detailed survey, length of some transmission lines has undergone changes. Some of the transmission system are likely to be completed beyond 2024-25. Also, some new transmission projects have been considered. Hence, against the planned transmission lines addition of 28700 ckm, the transmission network to be added by 2024-25 is about 27,000 ckm. The estimated cost of these projects is around Rs. 75,000 crores. Since, these are Inter-State Transmission projects and not confined to a particular State/UT and State/UT-wise cost is not feasible to be determined. Summary of Capacity Addition under PM GatiShakti National Master Plan is at Annexure. India has a robust National Grid which facilitates seamless power transfer from the resource rich areas to major load centres of the country with reliability & security. Power can be transferred from surplus regions/States to deficit regions/States. The capacity of National Grid is being expanded on a continuous basis to commensurate with the growth in electricity generation and electricity demand. As on 28-02-2023, Indian Transmission network includes 4,68,977 ckm of transmission lines (220kV and above voltage level) and 11,58,875 MVA of the transformation capacity in substations (220kV and above voltage level). The inter-regional capacity of the National Grid is 1,12,250 MW. The country has adequate transmission capacity. Power cuts are sometimes reported due to constraints in the State line transmission network and distribution networks or financial constraints with some Distribution Companies. The proposed Transmission projects under PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan is expected to further facilitate evacuation of power from generation projects with improved reliability of Power System Network in the country.

K. Singh\\n\\n\\nThere are power plants designed for using high calorific value imported coal. Therefore, the imports of coal for power generation cannot be reduced to zero. Cement, Sponge Iron, Aluminum industries utilize high calorific value low ash imported coal. The coal requirement for such category of consumers cannot be substituted by domestic coal. Thus, import of coal cannot be reduced to zero. In addition, thermal power plants have been importing coal for blending purpose from 2009 onwards. With the increase in electricity demand, the supply of coal to the power plants is not commensurate with the domestic coal requirement. The gap between daily coal consumption and daily arrival of domestic coal ranged from 2.65 Lakh Tonnes to 0.5 Lakh Tonnes between the months of September, 2022 and January, 2023. If the imports for blending had not been made, the coal stocks in thermal power plants would have reduced to zero in September, 2022 and would have continued so, leading to widespread power cuts and black outs. Therefore, Ministry of Power advised Central, State Gencos and Independent Power Producers (IPPs) on 09.01.2023 to import coal through a transparent competitive procurement for blending so as to have sufficient coal stocks at their power plants for smooth operations till September, 2023.

The Conference was organized by United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) in collaboration with the Ministry of Railways. The Conference was attended by the representatives of the Ministries of Transport/Railways of 18 countries including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Georgia, India, Islamic Republic of Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan (online), Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Nepal, Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Thailand, Uzbekistan (online) and Viet Nam. The representative from Asian Institute of Transport Development, Birmingham Center for Railway Research and Education, Organization for Cooperation Between Railways, International Union of Railways and International Organization for International Carriage by Rail also participated in the Conference. Addressing the Conference, the Chairman of Indian Railways Mr. Anil Kumar Lahoti lauded ESCAP on organizing the Conference on a very topical issue and inform the participants that Indian Railways is expanding its digital footprints on every aspect of rail transport and is ready to share its experience and expertise with the member of the Trans-Asian railway network and especially with those countries that are starting their rail digitalization journey. Trans-Asian railway network provides a coordinated plan for developing a regional rail network to support intra and inter-regional trade and transport. The 128,000-kilometer long rail network passes through 28 countries and was formalized through an Inter-governmental Agreement on Trans-Asian Railway network that entered into force in 2009. The Head of the UN ESCAP office in New Delhi Ms. Mikiko Tanaka also addressed the participants, emphasizing the need to leverage digitalization to further augment the operational performance of rail and increase freight and passenger transport by rail to support countries in realization of sustainable development goals. The Conference deliberated on ways and means to accelerate rail digital transformation in Asia and the Pacific to enhance competitiveness of rail transport to attract more freight and passenger to railway transport. The participating countries deliberated on a regional strategy on accelerating rail digital transformation in Asia and the Pacific that was presented by Mr. Sandeep Raj Jain, official from the Transport Division of UN ESCAP head office in Thailand. The proposed strategy aims to provide coherence and momentum to current initiatives on rail digitalization; foster an ecosystem to harnesses full potential of rail digitalization; augment the operational performance, capacity, reliability, safety, and security of rail assets; enhance customer experience including ease of doing business; create synergies through partnerships to digitalize rail; and ensure high level political support on rail digitalization. It further identifies eight priority areas and five cross cutting issues to deepen the regional cooperation on accelerating rail digital transformation. Among the cross-cutting issues, the strategy proposes to set up a regional capacity building programme on rail digital transformation with a pool of experts to enhance digital skills of railway officials. For financing rail digital projects, the strategy suggests countries to establish a rail digital and innovation fund as multi-donor trust fund to support landlocked and least developing countries to leapfrog to digital technologies. On strengthening rail cybersecurity, it advocates developing a regional framework for rail cybersecurity for sharing of information, capacity building and learning from experience. The strategy also aims to heighten engagement with private sector by encouraging countries to supportive legal and regulatory framework that attract private investments and expertise in rail digital applications. The proposed strategy also provides for implementation arrangements with suggestion to formulate national and sub-regional strategies on rail digitalization and measuring progress through developing a rail digital and innovation index complemented by three level of maturity for rail digitalization. The Conference participants welcomed the draft strategy on accelerating rail digital transformation presented by ESCAP secretariat and underlined that its adoption and subsequent implementation can fast track rail digitalization, particularly, for landlocked and least developing countries of the region. Ms. Jaya Varma Sinha, Member Operations and Business Development of Railway Board in her welcome address on the second day of the Conference also strongly supported the proposed draft of the regional strategy and informed the Conference on the willingness of the Indian railways to support regional rail digitalization initiatives through platform provided by ESCAP.

So far 28% work of Zojila Tunnel has been completed. With the construction of this tunnel, there will be all-weather connectivity for Ladakh. Curently the average travel time to cross the Zojila Pass sometimes takes three hours, after the completion of this tunnel the travel time will come down to 20 minutes. The reduction in travel time will ultimately result in fuel savings. The terrain near Zojila Pass is extremely inhospitable, with many fatal accidents taking place here every year. After the completion of Zojila Tunnel, the chances of accidents will be zero. This tunnel will provide year-round connectivity between the Kashmir Valley and Ladakh, which will be extremely important for the development of Ladakh, promotion of tourism, free movement of local goods and movement of Indian armed forces in case of emergency. ****\\nMJPS\\n\"),\n",

He was speaking at 11th Biennial International Conference on Ports, Shipping and Logistics held in Mumbai today. The Public transport system is very important for the country. The Minister expressed the view that about 40% of the total air pollution in the country is due to road traffic and it is necessary to promote public transport in the country. He said that the government is implementing various measures to promote public transport. He mentioned that the double decker bus started in Mumbai and the bus service being started in Bangalore are examples of these measures. The approval given to 260 rope ways and cable cars was also a part of this effort and road projects worth around Rs. 65 thousand crore are also underway in and around Delhi. After this work is completed, it will help reduce traffic congestion and air pollution in the region, he said. Apart from this, Shri. Gadkari said that the central government is also trying to build electric highways i.e. e highways. The Minister informed that electric buses, electric cars, electric scooters are now operational but along with that we are starting to use vehicles with flex engines. Union Minister Nitin Gadkari reiterated that hydrogen is the fuel of the future. Stating that there is no problem in running buses and trucks using methanol as fuel in Mumbai, the Minister said it would save costs and reduce pollution. On the occasion, the Union Minister expressed the belief that due to the Central Government’s efforts, the problem of pollution will be solved \\xa0to a large extent in the next five years. Expressing regret over the delay in the Mumbai Goa highway project, he said that several factors such as problems related to contractors as well as difficulties in land acquisition were responsible for the delay. But all these problems have been resolved and about 73 percent of the project has been completed, he said. He also expressed confidence that the work of Mumbai Goa highway will be completed within the stipulated time. The work of 36 green highway projects has been started on behalf of the central government and the government is paying more than the market value as compensation for land acquired for these projects. Therefore, land acquisition is no longer a problem in the construction of these roads, Gadkari also said on this occasion. We are working to reduce logistics cost to 9% which is current 14-16 per cent by 2024. Better roads and lower logistic costs will help in enhancement of trade business and industry, he said. On this occasion, Minister informed that 5-6 logistics parks will be set up in Maharashtra on behalf of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. He informed that the work of construction of dry ports at Jalna and Wardha in the state has been completed and now the work of construction of similar dry ports in Nashik and Pune is being undertaken. Speaking about logistic parks in the country, he said that with the help of newly developed infrastructure, we will able to reduce Agarbatti imports from China and instead use the indigenously developed sticks from the Assam. Shri. Gadkari expressed the opinion that if we can start water transport between Mumbai and Goa, the entire picture of transport in this region will change. The Union Minister opined that water transport is very cost-effective as compared to road and rail transport, and if we start using alternative fuels, the cost of this transport will be further reduced. The entire picture of transport can change if we are able to establish water transport between Mumbai and Goa. Water transport is extremely cost-effective when compared to road and rail transport and the costs can be brought down further if we are able to use alternative fuels, he said. While speaking about road accidents, the Union Minister said, the Government is looking into road engineering to reduce accidents and damage caused by them. The Minister appealed to people to follow road safety norms and requested organizations and NGOs to support the Government in the cause.

This special drive will go on till June 30th 2023 and aspires to bring all the vulnerable and marginalized rural households under the Self-Help Group (SHG) fold to enable them to draw benefits provided under the programme. The campaign's primary objective is to mobilize disadvantaged rural communities unaware of the benefits of the DAY-NRLM program. The campaign will be organized in all states, with the expectation of forming more than 1.1 lakh SHGs during the period through interventions like organizing General Body Meetings of Village Organizationsand experience sharing by SHG champions to motivate left out households to join SHGs, conducting Community Resource Persondrives, mobilizing eligible women from PMAY-G beneficiary households, training new SHG members, reviving defunct SHGs, opening SHG bank accounts and creation of a common database of SHGs promoted by other stakeholders. The campaign was launched by Shri Giriraj Singh, Minister of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj in New Delhi in the presence of dignitaries and officials from other ministries and lead partner banks. Also, present were Shri Shailesh Kumar Singh, Secretary - Rural Development, Shri Charanjit Singh, Additional Secretary – Rural Livelihoods and Smt. Smriti Sharan, Joint Secretary – Rural Livelihoods representing the Ministry and DAY-NRLM. CEOs, Mission Directors and senior mission staff from the State Rural Livelihoods Missions were the other notable guests present during the event. Speaking on the occasion Shri Giriraj Singh said, “The rural population accounts for 65% of India’s total population. Hence, it is extremely important that women from these areas are accorded all possible opportunities to enable them to contribute significantly into making our country a 5 trillion economy.When 10 crore SHG members all become LakhpatiDidis, it will automatically have a considerable effect on the country’s GDP. And this was the vision with which DAY-NRLM was started so that at least one woman member from every rural household can join a Self Help Group and take advantage of the opportunities and financial support offered under the programme to improve their livelihoods.I am pleased that on the occasion of celebrating 75 years of Independence, we are launching this “Sangathan Se Samriddhi” campaign to mobilize an additional 1 crore women to the 9 crore women already part of the SHG movement. Even then, let us not stop at 10 crores. Let us go beyond and ensure that all rural women across the country join the SHG movement. I urge all our SHG members to reach out to left out women in their respective villages and inspire them to join existing SHGs or form their own SHGs”. SHG women from across states actively participated in the event and women from Bihar, Tripura, Telangana, Maharashtra and Haryana shared their experiences on how the DAY-NRLM SHG movement supported them to come out of poverty by creating livelihood opportunities leading to their economic independence and social empowerment. *****\\nPK\\n\"),\n",

Out of the nine campaigns under this theme, five are under the Ministry of Rural Development viz., (i) Samagra Awaas under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G), (ii) Financial Literacy at District Level, (iii) Promoting Digital Transaction at Gram Panchayat Level and (iv) Social Mobilisation of Eligible Rural Women into Self Help Group (SHG) Network, (v) Plantation Drive on River Banks under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). Four other Campaigns are being led by the partnering Ministries/Departments viz., (i) Swastha Mahila- Samriddha Samaj (SMSS)- Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, (ii) Pashudhan Jagriti Abhiyan Intensive Awareness Campaign in Aspirational Districts-Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying, (iii) SVAMITVA, Meri Sampatti, Mera Haq- Ministry of Panchayati Raj and (iv )Natural Farming with SHG Women campaign-Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare. Under the Inclusive Development theme, the selection of the campaigns is focused on high-impact value and high Jan-Bhagidari potential. The campaigns are designed to have a “whole of society approach”, ensuring 100% outreach to the beneficiaries of the campaigns. The entire campaign is termed “Samaveshi Vikaas ”, which finds its foundation rooted in the concept of “Convergence” and “Reaching the last mile”, aiming at targeted interventions through all States/UTs, districts and gram panchayats, focusing on selected campaigns in the areas of employment generation, health, social inclusion, social security and livelihood creation by each of the participating ministries/departments. With a view to capturing and monitoring the progress of these campaigns, a website has been designed named “https://akam-samveshivikaas.nic.in” which is proposed to be launched by the Prime Minister on 24th April, 2023 on the National Panchayati Raj Day at a function at Rewa, Madhya Pradesh. This vibrant and dynamic website will provide real-time progress of various activities under Samaveshi Vikaas campaigns and will also capture the key performance indicators, calendar of events, event-related pictures and videos, newspaper clippings and public opinion. The website will enable this Department to generate reports and assess and monitor the progress of the campaigns through technical tools. In order to ensure the documentation of Jan Bhagidari and public participation, a simple and user-friendly Mobile App named “Samaveshi Vikaas” has been designed. Through this, the general public can share their experience and opinion/feedback about the impact and benefits these campaigns have brought along with photographs on these campaigns.

The algorithm called predictor discovery algorithm (PDA) made using a single ocean-related variable could facilitate skillful forecast of the ISMR in time for making effective agricultural and other economic plans for the country. While researchers have well established the scientific basis for ISMR predictability and made significant advances over the past century in understanding the variability and predictability of ISMR, the skillful prediction of ISMR even one month in advance has remained a major challenge. Neither the potential (theoretically possible) skill (correlation between the predicted and observed ISMR) and the actual skill of ISMR forecast are available at longer lead times--6, 12, 18, 24- months ahead of the season. Traditionally, researchers select a predictor of ISMR based on the maximum correlation of an atmospheric or oceanic variable with ISMR over a region of the globe. Such technique restricts in the realization of the true potential predictability of ISMR as it accounts for one predictor over a particular region at a time. Scientists at the Institute of Advanced Study in Science and Technology (IASST), Guwahati, an autonomous institute of DST along with their collaborators have found that the widely used sea surface temperature (SST) is inadequate for calculation of long-lead prediction of ISMR. This, they found was because the potential skill of ISMR estimated by the predictor discovery algorithm (PDA) using SST-based predictors was low at all the lead months. The team consisting of IASST Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, and Cotton University, Guwahati, devised a predictor discovery algorithm (PDA) that generates predictor at any lead month by projecting the ocean thermocline depth (D20) over the entire tropical belt between 1871 and 2010 onto the correlation map between ISMR and D20 over the same period. This encapsulated all the potential drivers over the entire tropical region in order to realize the true potential skill of ISMR prediction at any lead month. This is because this one predictor embedded the simultaneous contribution of all the potential drivers over the entire tropical belt at any lead month identified by the correlation map. Besides, the oceanic thermocline depth (D20) is least influenced by the stochastic atmospheric noise. The new algorithm indicates that the potential skill of ISMR is maximum (0.87, highest being 1.0) 18-months before the ISMR season. At any lead month, the predictability of the annual variability of ISMR depends on the degree of regularities in the annual variability of its drivers. With the newly discovered basis of long-lead ISMR predictability in place, Devabrat Sharma (IASST), Dr. Santu Das (IASST), Dr. Subodh K. Saha (IITM), and Prof. B.'),\n",

The success of the model was based on the ability of artificial intelligence (AI) to learn the relationship between ISMR and tropical thermocline patterns from 150 years of simulations by 45 physical climate models and transferring that learning to actual observations between 1871 and 1974.

Uric acid is one of the most important antioxidants that maintain blood pressure stability and reduce oxidative stress in living beings. The usual range of uric acid in blood ranges from 0.14 to 0.4 mmol dm-3, and for urine, 1.5 to 4.5 mmol dm-3. However, the fluctuation of uric acid levels due to the lack of balancing between the production and excretion causes several diseases like hyperuricemia, which in turn may lead to gout disease, type 2 diabetes, increase risk of cardiovascular diseases, Lesch–Nyhan syndrome, hypertension, and renal disorders. Researchers from the Institute of Advanced Study in Science and Technology (IASST), an autonomous institute of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), fabricated this device made up of reduced phosphorene quantum dots -- a new class of zero-dimensional functional nanostructures with unique physicochemical and surface properties. The quantum dots show distinctive electrical performance in biomedical applications and so can be used in fabricating high-performance electrical biosensors. The current-voltage and the impedance (opposition electron flow) responses for the fabricated device have been studied with increased uric acid concentration. With the increase in uric acid concentration, the current density increases and shows a maximum current of about 1.35 ×10-6 A. The fabricated device shows reversibility in interaction with the uric acid, which repeatedly enables the use of the device for sensing experiments. It outperforms all currently available ones in terms of effectiveness and cost because it doesn't need any enzymes. The response of the fabricated device was investigated with real samples like human blood serum and artificial urine. The device so developed is simple, portable, cost-effective, and easy to fabricate for detecting uric acid with a limit of about 0.809 µM. This work, led by Prof. Neelotpal Sen Sarma and his Ph. D student Nasrin Sultana was recently published in the journal ACS Applied Electronic Materials.

The latest spectroscopic results from GN-z11 -- identified as\\xa0one of the distant and early galaxies-- has confirmed a complete absence of dust particles\\xa0from its surroundings for an interim time period despite possessing a very high star formationrate. The process of star formation and the subsequent stellar evolution inevitably generates\\xa0massive amounts of dust and makes the host galaxy opaque to some extent due to the\\xa0apparent view of a thick veil around it. This textbook-like phenomenon has been missing in\\xa0GN-z11’s behaviour, leaving astronomers amazed beyond measure. A compact galaxy containing dense matter, GN-z11, was first discovered in 2015 by the\\xa0Hubble Space Telescope (HST). GN-z11 displays a high redshift (of the order z = 10.95). This implies that it is located approximately 32 billion light years away from the Earth. Even\\xa0though it has been in existence since the Universe was barely 400 million years old post the\\xa0Big Bang event, it is surprising that GN-z11 had already formed a billion solar mass worth of\\xa0stars, an anomalous behaviour according to astronomers. Back then, GN-z11 already\\xa0possessed approximately three percent of the total stellar mass of what our own galaxy, the\\xa0Milky Way, holds today when the Universe is 14 billion years old. Astronomers intrigued by the absence of dust in GN-z11 have tried to unravel the mystery\\xa0behind it. Scientists of the Raman Research Institute, an autonomous institute of the\\xa0Department of Science and Technology (DST), have inferred the possible physical\\xa0characteristics of the violent dynamical events that could have resulted in the destruction and\\xa0evacuation of dust out of the galaxy on a relatively short time, making in transparent. The scientists have demonstrated that the energetics of the observed star formation rate was\\xa0sufficient to tear apart the dusty veil on time-scales of 20–25 Myr. They have also shown that\\xa0this was a temporary phenomenon and was followed soon after by the last of the supernovae\\xa0explosions resulting in the shrinking of the expanding shell, thereby obscuring the galaxy on\\xa0time-scales of around 5–8 Myr. “It is simply mind-boggling to think when and how GN-z11 gathered so much of gas which\\xa0ultimately collapsed to form massive stars and remained dust-free. And all this, while the\\xa0galaxy came into existence when our Universe was very young, that is, around 420 million\\xa0years,” remarked lead author of the newest paper Prof. Biman Nath, senior faculty at the\\xa0Raman Research Institute (RRI), funded by the Department of Science and Technology. Some of the possible reasons to explain this temporary disappearance of dust clouds, the\\xa0study states, are – the suppression of dust by reverse shocks from a supernovae explosion,\\xa0destruction of dust by supernovae-triggered shocks, evacuation of dust by gaseous outflow\\xa0driven by other stellar activity. Likewise, the re-emergence of the dust veil could be linked\\xa0with the massive gravitation force possessed by GN-z11. Prof. Nath, along with his Russian collaborators Evgenii O Vasiliev, Sergey A. Drozdov, and\\xa0Yuri A. Shchekinov from the Lebedev Physical Institute, used observations of the past five\\xa0years obtained from the Keck telescopes located at Mauna Kea in the Hawaiian Islands. In\\xa0the present study titled ‘Dust-free starburst galaxies at redshift z&gt;10’ published recently in\\xa0the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, the researchers developed\\xa0specialised computer simulations to understand anomalous galactic behaviour displayed by\\xa0GN-z11 to prove a new possibility that galaxies with high redshift could remain dust-free. “Computing and simulating data of 25- 30 million years, during which the dust levels around\\xa0this distant galaxy was negligible, making it appear nearly transparent, was challenging,” said\\xa0Prof. Nath, who dubbed this phenomenon involving vanishing and re-emerging of dust clouds\\xa0as a possibly an intermittent activity never known before. Astronomers are now beginning to believe that many primeval galaxies could show similar\\xa0opacity but have remained undetected. However, the study of high redshift galaxies could get\\xa0more complex and exciting starting in the near future with better data generated by the\\xa0recently launched James Webb Space Telescope. <><><><><>\\nSNC/SM\\n'),\n",

Dr Jitendra Singh said that the idea of setting up these museums is to help enable the common citizens particularly the youngsters to realise their hidden potential and sometimes even discover their inherent aptitudes of which they themselves may not be aware of. It also ignites curiosity in them which then may help sharpen their scientific temper and inspire creative innovation. The Science Museum is a major museum on Exhibition Road in South Kensington, London. It was founded in 1857. The management of the museum was particularly impressed by India’s covid success story. The tour mainly focussed on areas of Energy revolution, Vaccines and Space gallery. The Minister was taken around the exclusive pavilion set up to trace the history of Covid pandemic right from the first case that appeared to the first person who got vaccinated. The history has been recorded in chronological order for the awareness and education of people. India’s lead role in the management and prevention of Covid has shown to be recognised in the pavilion. The Minister was impressed with another pavilion devoted exclusively to the tropical diseases prevalent in the Indian subcontinent and special section of the exhibition with banners written in Hindi language dedicated to the polio eradication programme led by India which has been an iconic role model for the rest of the world in the area of preventive healthcare. Dr Jitendra Singh said that India is fast emerging as the world's major bio-economy and over the last few years, it has grown by leaps and bounds when it comes to innovation and technology. He pointed out that India has developed four indigenous Vaccines in just two years. The Minister added that the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) in Ministry of Science & Technology has through “Mission COVID Suraksha”, delivered four vaccines, augmented the manufacturing of Covaxin, and created necessary infrastructure for smooth development of future vaccines, so that our country is pandemic ready. Dr Jitendra Singh said that the world is now increasingly realising India’s superlative capacities in the preventive healthcare and we are now in the process of developing several other vaccines in the series. Recently after the first DNA vaccine, the first nasal vaccine has also been successfully manufactured and an other vaccine related to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) which has helped in the prevention of cervical cancer has also been developed. Dr Jitendra Singh underlined that the Indian vaccine market, which has carved out a place for itself at the global level, is expected to reach a valuation of Rs 252 billion by 2025. He also called for Extended Collaboration in Biotech StartUps and Vaccine Development between India and the United Kingdom. Dr Jitendra Singh is leading a high-level official Indian delegation of the Ministry of Science & Technology on a 6-day visit to the United Kingdom. *****\\nSNC/SM\\n\"),\n",

The Minister told the students that in the wake of a series of youth-centric policies initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, this was possibly one of the best times happening for the youth and the students in India. On the occasion of the visit of Dr Jitendra Singh to Imperial College London, the College Management announced scholarships of £ 400,000 for the Indian students studying in the college out of which 50% of the scholarship would be given to the female students from India. While addressing the gathering, Dr Jitendra Singh said that he is glad to be in one of the most innovative universities in Europe which has given the world, among other things, penicillin, holography, and fibre optics. Imperial College London is a public research university in London, England. Imperial ranks first in the UK for research outputs, first in the UK for research environment, and first for research impact among Russell Group universities. It is also home to the MS and Parkinson’s Tissue Bank, a collection of ‘central nervous system tissue samples donated by individuals with multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease and related conditions’. It’s part of a collection making up the UK’s largest brain bank — around 1,650 specimens are stored at -80ºC, with samples from the organs being used in research projects at more than 100 different institutions around the world. In the last five years Imperial academics co-authored just over 1,200 research publications with partners at more than 300 Indian institutions. Research partners include the Indian Institute of Science Bangalore, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Christian Medical College, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. There are currently 700 Indian students at the College, and in India there is a community of more than 3,000 alumni. Dr Jitendra Singh had a lively interaction with the Indian students lasting for about an hour and said that this is one of the best times for the youth in India particularly because Prime Minister Narendra Modi has in the last 9 years done away with many bottlenecks and removed several deterrent rules and created an enabling milieu where youth can realise their aspirations. The Minister cited the example of the space sector having being opened up for private participants. Now there are hundreds of StartUps even in the space sector. The StartUp movement has been given a personal boost by Prime Minister Modi as a result of which the figure has gone up from 350 to more than 90,000 with more than 100 unicorns, he said. The Minister said that the Biotech sector which was earlier ignored has also been attended by the present Government and students are showing increasing interest in it particularly after the vaccine success story. As a result from 50 StartUps in 2014, now we have nearly 6000 Bio StartUps. As promising young students from India, Imperial College London is going to be your Alma mater for the rest of your life, but at the same time you should go back home and dedicate all your knowledge and learning gathered from here, the Minister said. The Minister highlighted that India has emerged as the third-largest global start-up ecosystem, growing at an annual rate of 12-15%. There are lots of opportunities to expand India-Imperial connect through various programmes to create global impact. Dr Jitendra Singh mentioned that Prime Minister Modi repeatedly called upon the Indian students to prepare for the next 25 years as independent India is turning 100.

Chandrasekhar, Secretary, Department of Science and Technology, released the “National Manufacturing Innovation Survey (NMIS) 2021-22: Summary for Policymakers\" on April 27, 2023. “The National Manufacturing Innovation Survey (NMIS) 2021-22 was undertaken by DST as the Government of India has prioritised enhancing the competitiveness of Indian manufacturing and increasing its share in the GDP,” Dr. Chandrasekhar said while launching the summary report for policymakers that encapsulated the results of the survey. “The survey findings offer wide-ranging insights into the enabling activities and barriers to innovation by firms and has closely evaluated how states and sectors have performed with respect to the manufacturing firms’ ability to produce new products, services and business processes. The detailed analysis of the survey results also provides valuable insights on the innovation ecosystem in India. Thus, I anticipate this report to be of great interest to policymakers, researchers, and practitioners in the field of innovation and economic development”, Dr Chandrasekhar elaborated. Dr. Chandrasekhar highlighted that these learnings can add significant value to the Make-in-India programme objective, specifically the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, positioned to boost manufacturing in a variety of sectors, including electronics, pharmaceuticals, and automobiles, that are already yielding results. He added that innovators should come out with really good innovations that are affordable, and require minimal changes in processes, and the resultant products should be cheaper, better, and environment friendly. Also, there should be enough factories with the capacity to absorb innovations. “The NMIS study & findings will contribute to strengthening the baselines to some of capacities and capabilities, opportunities and challenges in the manufacturing value-chains that require immediate attention,” Dr. Chandrasekhar pointed out. The National Manufacturing Innovation Survey (NMIS) 2021-22 is a joint study by the Department of Science and Technology (DST) and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) to evaluate the innovation performance of manufacturing firms in the India. The NMIS 2021-22 study was conducted as a 2-pronged survey that examined the innovation processes, outcomes, and barriers in manufacturing firms and also studied the innovation ecosystem that affects innovation outcomes in these firms. This study is a follow-up of DST’s first National Innovation Survey held in 2011. The collaborative study by DST-UNIDO allowed a 360-degree approach to measuring manufacturing innovation outcomes, processes, and barriers at the firm level, mapping the contributing processes and interactions and thereby assessing the performance of states, sectors, and firm sizes. Dr. Akhilesh Gupta, Secretary SERB, Senior Adviser, and Head PCPM, DST, gave the outline of the survey and said that the survey offered an empirical understanding of current innovation activities of the manufacturing economy in India as well as ways to navigate organisational rigidity to facilitate market demand for innovations. “Evidences of the barriers and challenges to technological learning, innovation and development, and up-gradation of Indian industries shall be used for devising policies, programs, and partnerships to strengthen innovation outcomes and benefits,” he added. “The NMIS survey shows that innovation is not yet common in manufacturing but has proved to be profitable for firms. Focus on manufacturing innovation is needed in addition to expanding production,” said Dr. René Van Berkel, Representative & Head, Regional Office in India, UNIDO. The NMIS 2021-22 survey had two specific components: the firm-level survey and the sectorial systems of innovation (SSI) survey. The Firm-level survey captured data related to types of innovations and innovative measures taken by firms, including the process of innovation, access to finance, resources, and information for innovation, besides also recording the factors impacting the innovation activities in a firm. One in four firms was found to have successfully implemented an innovation in the observation period, and over 80% of these firms benefitted significantly in expanding markets and production and reducing costs. The Sectorial System of Innovation survey mapped the manufacturing innovation system and its enabling role in achieving innovations in firms. The SSI study measured the interactions between stakeholders of the innovation ecosystem, relative barriers to innovation, as well as the convergence or divergence of current policy instruments in select five key manufacturing sectors important to the Indian economy – textiles; food & beverage; automotive; pharma; and ICT. A total of 8,087 firms participated in the firm-level survey, while 5,488 firms and non-firms participated in the SSI survey. The findings from the firm-level survey are captured in the ‘Assessment of Firm-Level Innovation in Indian Manufacturing’. Separately, five reports from the study of the sectorial systems of innovation within five manufacturing sectors, namely, Automotive, Pharmaceutical, Textile, Food & Beverages, and Information & Communication Technologies (ICT), have been developed.

The Central Ganga Plain serves as a food basket for thickly populated India and is undergoing significant upheavals in terms of climatic (monsoonal) variability in recent decades. Future scenario assessment requires rigorous climate models which are built utilizing key data inputs (of this eco-system) emerged from well-dated palaeo-reconstructions. A considerable number of records are available from the Central Ganga Plain with restricted information on palaeo-environmental reconstruction. Modern proxies to distinguish different ecology and depositional environment at the appropriate spatial scale are limited, and generation of such proxies is vital for decoding the past environment in the CGP. Furthermore, the Ghaghara-Gandak and Ganga-Ghaghara interfluve regions are areas where several meter-thick sediments have been deposited during the Late Quaternary. The interfluve regions are comprised of different depositional environments, such as fluvial, lacustrine, forest, and croplands, so they are important for past environmental and modern analogue studies. The soil/sediment samples can be complemented with biotic (pollen, diatoms, and phytoliths) and abiotic proxies (sediment texture, stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes, XRD/ XRF elements, and magnetic susceptibility parameters). The BSIP, an autonomous institute of DST, evaluated the strength and weaknesses of biotic and abiotic proxy records of the Ghaghara-Gandak and Ganga-Ghaghara interfluves of CGP. For the first time, they adopted a holistic approach towards developing multiproxy modern analogues from the two interfluves, which would be an accurate reference tool for the palaeo-ecological studies in the Central Ganga Plain and surrounding areas. The study published in the journal Catena, evaluated both the strength and weaknesses of these proxies and assessed how reliably multiproxy modern analogues can identify different ecological and depositional environments and could be used as a baseline in interpreting Late Quaternary palaeo-environmental and ecological changes more accurately in this region. The study of biotic and abiotic interactions is important as they aid in building the forest community, food crops, agro-pastoral and human settlements in this region. Consequently, the palaeo-ecological data would assist in better understanding the past and also the sustainable future projections in the Central Ganga Plain. For example, the inception of human settlement in this region could also be traced through the establishment of marker pollen, phytolith, and diatom taxa. The high/low occurrences of annual herbs like Euphorbiaceae and Convolvulaceae (marker pollen taxa) indicated the monsoonal fluctuation in the Central Ganga Plain. Besides, the different cultural pollen taxa apprised how human-associated changes have reduced the forest cover in the CGP, and hence those forest trees should be plated that can generate and sustain our life-supporting system by giving out oxygen and also combat the rising CO2 levels by carbon sequestration. The work stands out due to the fact that the fossil pollen represents the plant upto species level and hence could directly trace vegetation changes, and pollen could be an accurate tool for monitoring the large-scale variability in climate change scenarios. The study would help measure the dynamics of the natural vegetation and the shifts in human occupation over time for future scenario development. This modern comprehensive dataset could provide background information for the Late Quaternary palaeo-ecological reconstruction from the Central Ganga Plain along with the practices for preserving and conserving the endangered biodiversity that flourishes in forests, crops, lakes, and rivers system of this region. The lakes of the CGP, which were once proliferated with water and supported human settlement, are presently drying up and need to be preserved and cleaned so that the rich biodiversity flourishing in and around the lakes could be used for sustainable future development. Hence the various proxies used in this study helps in generating eco-environmental prospect of wetland and sediments status in this region. The multiparameter study could also be viewed as an important baseline for conserving different lakes and river systems, often treated as wastelands to be drained, filled, and converted for other purposes. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2023.106975.'),\n",

It can detect that RBD antigen of the SARS-CoV-2 at an early stage of infection with a visual line of detection (LOD). Popularly used gold standard techniques such as RT-PCR and ELISA are usually time-consuming, require skilled labor, specific equipment and are not feasible for on-site detection. In order to overcome this challenge, a team of reserachers from DBT-National Institute of Animal Biotechnology (NIAB) and Gandhi Medical College developed a rapid and robust platform for early and on-field detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus. A smartphone app (Color grab) has been used for the qualitative analysis of the test strip. The developed LFIA working on the principle of antigen-antibody interaction holds the potential to be used for detection of SARS-CoV-2 without any requirement of skilled personnel and subsequently reduce the spread of the virus. With support from Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), an institution of the Department of Science and Technology (DST) the scientists came together to clone the gene responsible for RBD protein expression, and purify it to generate the antibody(Ab). The generated antibodies were then conjugated with monodisperse gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to be used as a capture probe for colorimetric detection. The fabricated LFIA works in a sandwich format, where the RBD target analyte in the sample interacts with the gold nanoparticle conjugated RBD antibody to form a complex (AuNPs-Ab), which further moves along the nitrocellulose membrane and reacts with the RBD antibody coated as test line on the membrane to form a red colour band. The RBD Ab and IgG secondary Ab were coated on the nitrocellulose membrane as test and control, respectively to test the presence of antigen (Ag) in the sample. Further, the excess antibody bonded with the control line coated with secondary IgG antibody validating the functionality of the test strip. An absorbent pad was placed at the end of the strip to prevent backflow across the strip. The presence of band colour at test and control line indicates a positive result whereas a single line in control indicates a negative result. Depending on the target analyte, various parameters such as blocking buffer, antibody conjugation concentration, and antibody coating concentration on the membrane have been optimized to obtain band color with maximum binding efficiency. The band intensity of the test line was analysed using a simple smartphone-based application for image acquisition and analysis of the test line color, which can split any color data into its three primary color components -- red, green, and blue (RGB data). The specific color component shows the trend of increasing or decreasing intensity of color. This study was published in the Journal of Medical Virology recently. The developed LFIA strips can be useful as a portable, point of care device (PoC) for on-site detection of SARS-CoV-2 particularly at\\xa0 home or even in rural areas. Moreover, the cost of LFIA strips is much less as compared to standard RT-PCR test making it a more economical option for people who cannot afford the RT-PCR test.

These waves play an important role in precipitation of killer electrons (electrons having speed close to speed of light, which form the radiation belt of planet Earth), which are hazardous to our space-borne technology/instruments. The study can help understand the impact of energetic particles in the radiation belts on the low orbiting satellites. More than 99% of the matter in the visible universe consists of plasma. Our Sun, solar wind, the interplanetary medium, near-Earth region, magnetosphere (the cavity in which the Earth lies and stays protected from the wrath of the Sun), and upper part of our atmosphere all consist of plasma—the fourth state of matter. The study of plasma waves provides us with information on regions inaccessible to us, transport mass and energy across different regions, how they interact with charged particles, and control the overall dynamics of the Earth’s magnetosphere. One such wave is the Electromagnetic Ion Cyclotron (EMIC), traversing plasma waves observed in the Earth’s magnetosphere. They can resonate with electrons with a wide energy range --- from 500 keV to hundreds of MeV, and make them precipitate to high-latitude atmosphere. A team of scientists from the Indian Institute of Geomagnetism (IIG), an autonomous institute of DST, analysed data collected between 2011 and 2017 by the Induction Coil Magnetometer data, installed at the Indian Antarctic station Maitr to bring out several aspects of the ground observation of the EMIC waves. They found the location of the generation of the waves in space and also suggested that the lower-frequency waves modulate the higher-frequency waves. This first attempt to investigate the modulation characteristics using large data to present a statistical scenario of modulation of EMIC waves at ground station Maitri, published in the journal JGR Space Physics showed that the short-period modulation of such wave events is common and dependent on EMIC wave frequency. Besides, the short period decreases with an increase in the peak frequency of the EMIC wave, and stronger EMIC wave events were likely to have a higher peak frequency. Such study is important to improve our understanding of EMIC wave modulation and how they interact with energetic particles that impact satellites and their communication.

In light of the vision by our Hon’ble PM that India's self-reliance will be based on five pillars -- economy, infrastructure, technology-driven system, vibrant demography, and demand it is prudent to strengthen the foundation of relevant R&D infrastructure across the Nation to contribute to the development of a self-reliant India,” Dr. Singh said at the inauguration of the Utsav. Dr Jitendra Singh said that in order to meet these diverse challenges and strengthen the S&T infrastructure support system in the universities and other related academic institutions, the Department of Science and Technology (DST) nurtures and supports a variety of infrastructure related schemes like FIST, PURSE, SAIF, etc. towards augmenting/ facilitating the R&D equipment for research activities at various Universities/ Institutes and other Academic organizations as well as promote industry-academia linkages.It’s our endeavour that the youth of our country have access to quality R&D infrastructure to pursue research in all areas of S&T,” Dr. Singh added while speaking at the Utsav organised to showcase the achievements of the PURSE supported Universities. Dr Jitendra Singh said that the Honourable Prime Minister’s vision is to step up the efforts in various fields to make the country ‘the most advanced laboratory for modern science’ in the ‘Amrit Kaal’-the next 25 years leading to the centenary of India’s Independence. Working towards this vision, the Government has committed to invest heavily on building research infrastructure in the country. Under FIST Program, DST has supported 3074 Departments and PG Colleges at a total budget of about Rs. 3130.82 crores for Scientific Infrastructure Building in various STEM Departments in Universities and academic institutions. Dr. Singh pointed out that flexible infrastructure grants are being provided to universities nationwide to keep up the vigour of conducting highly challenging R&D activities with an investment of Rs 950 Crores till date. The Promotion of University Research and Scientific Excellence (PURSE) with a nationwide reach supports the university’s research ecosystem by making high-end research equipment available to our academicians/scientists, enabling our universities to compete with global standards. The Union Minister launched a new scheme, SUPREME, a first-of-its-kind program by the Government of India, to provide financial support for repair/ upgradation/ maintenance/ retrofitting or acquiring additional attachments to increase functional capabilities of existing analytical instrumentation facilities (AIFs) during the programme. Dr. S Chandrasekhar, DST Secretary said that the future of scientific research will call for deeper and more widespread multidisciplinary collaboration among countries which will enable researchers to optimize the precondition of securing sustainable scientific collaboration. India can escalate this through deeper collaborations while hosting the G20 nations. Department of Science and Technology has supported numerous Universities to augment their research infrastructure as they are striving towards potentially high-impact, interdisciplinary research (both basic and applied) aligned to national priorities and missions.

The wide range of issues discussed by the two Ministers included UK-India “Roadmap 2030”\\nDr Jitendra Singh highlighted the close collaboration between the two countries strengthened through the ambitious ‘Roadmap 2030’ which was emphasised by Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Rishi Sunak on the side-lines of the G-20 Summit in Bali. ‘Roadmap 2030’ provides a framework for UK-India relations across health, climate, trade, education, science and technology, and defence. Dr Jitendra Singh congratulated the Government of the United Kingdom for formation of a new Department of Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) and said that it reflects the Government’s desire to place technology and innovation at the core of the UK economy. Both the leaders agreed that an India UK technology partnership is central to the vision and prosperity today and for the future generations of both the countries. Dr Jitendra Singh expressed satisfaction on the progress made since the last Science and Innovation Council Meeting held in New Delhi in July 2018. We could have met in 2020 but then the pandemic changed the whole dynamics, including changed priorities. Even during the pandemic, both countries had a new and successful partnership on vaccines. The bilateral scientific cooperation has become truly multi-dimensional as India UK S & T partnership covers all aspects of Research and Innovation which is required for both nations to rise to new heights together, he added. Dr Jitendra Singh said that he strongly believes that India can lead the newly industrialising countries in developing and adopting affordable technologies and processes, and demonstrate a growth path and low-energy consumption pattern that would be far more sustainable than that of the industrial countries. The Minister recalled that during the last India-UK virtual summit held in May 2021, both the Prime Ministers had adopted an ambitious ‘Roadmap 2030’ that provides the framework for UK-India relations across health, climate, trade, education, science and technology, and defence. Prime Ministers from both countries emphasised their shared commitment to an enhanced partnership in science, education, research and innovation, he said. Minister George Freeman said, he hoped that in today’s meeting, both leaders would be able to identify new cooperation opportunities for the scientific communities of India and UK to achieve the task given by the Prime Ministers of both countries. Dr Jitendra Singh said that in India, the present Government has laid emphasis on promoting the value chain of innovation, entrepreneurship and IP generation. The Indian innovation system is more purpose driven rather than process driven with focus on affordability and accessibility. Make in India, Digital India, Clean India, StartUp India and Smart Cities initiatives of the current government provides a very fertile platform for us to engage and collaborate with the UK, he added. The Minister mentioned that the India-UK Global Innovation Partnership (GIP) Programme is a great step to foster, transfer and scale up demonstrated and sustainable climate smart innovations from India to select developing countries with the ultimate aim of accelerating the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Dr Jitendra Singh said that in the recent past, Govt of India has, under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi, launched several flagship initiatives such as the National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber Physical Systems (ICPS); Quantum Computing and Communication; National Mission on Supercomputing, Electric Mobility, Green hydrogen etc. which provides new opportunities for collaboration. Both the Ministers agreed on the fact that the global challenges we face today do not respect geopolitical boundaries and hence can be effectively addressed through scientific collaboration and not competition. The Minister added that the Indian scientists are globally recognized for their research capabilities. But conversion of research into commercial technologies for wealth creation and lab to market transition is a challenge the country needs to face head on. Dr Jitendra Singh said he hoped that the partnership for the joint research leading to development of commercially viable products, processes or services would provide greater returns, in terms of economic and societal benefit to the common man and on money spent by the two governments on R&D. Minister Freeman concluded by saying that he is looking forward to further deliberations with the Union Minister Dr Jitendra Singh during his visit to the UK on how both countries can focus on making S&T cooperation mutually beneficial with stronger economic impact for their citizens. Dr Jitendra Singh is leading a high-level official Indian delegation of the Ministry of Science & Technology on a 6-day visit to UK. *****\\nSNC/SM\\n'),\n",

Delivering the inaugural address of the National Conference on “Disaster Resilient Methodologies on Pandemic” at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) here, Dr Jitendra Singh said that India’s Covid management was hugely successful under the able leadership of our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. During the Covid pandemic, when the world thought that India would be the biggest Covid hotspot, we emerged stronger and within 2 years, came out with 2 vaccines and provided the same to more than 50 countries around the world, he added. Dr Jitendra Singh said that as compared to other countries, India's strategy against Covid was more effective than any other countries in the world. Due to this pandemic we got to know the loopholes as well as strengths of our system. He added that from the very onset of the pandemic, Prime Minister Modi used to personally monitor the Covid management twice a day. The Minister said that India has deep and strong inherent potential. Before Covid, the country was not known for preventive healthcare. But turning the adversity into a virtue, India emerged as a role model of Preventive healthcare. This is one of the best success stories India under Prime Minister Modi has given to the world. It has raised our esteem on the global stage, he added. Dr Jitendra Singh said that with each challenge the country has emerged stronger and this is because right from May 2014, our Prime Minister has been preparing the nation for different catastrophes. Citing the assistance provided by India during the 2015 Nepal earthquake or launching the SAARC satellite, he said that we are serving not only our community but also our neighbouring communities which is a practice very much rooted in our Indian ethos. The Minister said that during the first lockdown in that disastrous and chaotic situation, NGOs, government and corporates came together to tackle this situation. SPARC, Pune and RSS Jankalyan Pune sheds light on work done regarding the same during these times in the form of case studies which are to be published today. Though the books consist of case studies of western Maharashtra, I believe that it is a short representation of the work done in the GVP model in entire India. Such practical knowledge which can be gained by case studies in this book should serve as reference in all the disaster management centers / institutes and universities, he added. The Minister mentioned that Covid has not only taught us how to handle adversity but has generated unexplored interest in biotechnology among the youth. He added that before 2014, there were only 50 biotech StartUps, but now there are almost 6,000. Also India's bio-economy has grown 8 times in the last 8 years under Prime Minister Modi from $10 billion in 2014 to over $80 billion in 2022. Dr Jitendra Singh concluded by saying that today’s youth will define India @2047 when India will celebrate its freedom centenary as they have the privilege and opportunity to contribute to the making of ‘New India’ as envisaged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. *****\\nSNC/SM\\n\"),\n",

Speaking as chief guest at “Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat” celebration here, Dr Jitendra Singh said that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel played a pivotal role in the integration of more than 560 princely states to constitute the post-independence Indian Union. Unfortunately, Patel was not allowed to handle Jammu & Kashmir because the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru thought that he knew J&K better. Later, Nehru also declared a unilateral ceasefire and thus prevented Indian forces from retrieving back the present ‘Pakistan occupied Jammu Kashmir’(PoJK) from the Pak intruders, he said. The Minister further said, had Sardar Patel been given a free hand, the history of Indian subcontinent would have been different. PoJK would not have been there, whole of Jammu & Kashmir would have been a part of India and this issue would not have lingered on for so many decades, he said. The anomaly of Article 370 and 35A, said Dr Jitendra Singh, persisted for more than 70 years and the nation had to wait for Prime Minister Modi to come and do the course correction. Therein lies the significance of ‘Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat’ and it is a providential coincidence that the vision of ‘Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat' was declared by Prime Minister Modi on 31st October, 2015 which happened to be the 140th birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Dr Jitendra Singh said that in J&K, in the garb of Article 370, those who were votaries of the Article were actually misusing it to sustain themselves in power. Otherwise, what was the political logic of holding back social reforms like the Dowry Prohibition Act 1961, Prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006 etc. if not to appease certain sections of society for vote bank, he asked. Talking about the North East of India, Dr Jitendra Singh said that before 2014, North East used to show up in the news for all the wrong reasons mainly encounters, Dharnas, road blockades, poor rail and road connectivity and violence. But all that has dramatically changed. In the last 9 years, Prime Minister Modi has visited the North East more than 60 times which may be more than the total number of visits made by all the previous PMs put together. He added that earlier governments took North East for granted but today the region is a model of ‘Vikas’ for the rest of the country. The Minister further added that Prime Minister Modi has won the trust of the people of North East by ensuring all round development in the region. Now the youth of North East are in high demand throughout the country for their skill and are excelling in different fields. Business houses are looking upto North East as an attractive destination for investment. For example, a small Northeastern state like Mizoram with a population of hardly 10 lakh has set up Indian’s subcontinent’s first-of-its-kind specialised “Citrus Food Park” with Israel’s collaboration which has been hailed as a “Centre of Excellence”. Dr Jitendra Singh concluded by saying that the new political culture brought in by Prime Minister Narendra Modi coupled with the tremendous pace in development has broken the mental and physical barriers, and united the country as ‘Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat’. *****\\nSNC/SM\\n\"),\n",

Dr Jitendra Singh was speaking at a function at Rashtrapati Bhavan where “National Innovation Awards”, instituted by the Union Ministry of Science & Technology, were presented to \"Grassroot Innovators\" by the President of India, Droupadi Murmu. The Minister said that there were just around 350 StartUps before 2014, but after Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave the clarion call from the ramparts of the Red Fort in his Independence Day address and rolled out special StartUp scheme in 2016, there has been a quantum jump in StartUps to more than 90,000 with more than 100 Unicorns. Dr Jitendra Singh further added that simultaneously Prime Minister Modi opened up the Space sector for private participation leading to more than 100 StartUps in the Space sector within just about three years. Similarly, Biotech StartUps went up from around 50 to nearly 6,000, he said. Dr Jitendra Singh said that India had no dearth of talent, capability, innovation and creativity in the youth, but they were lacking a favourable milieu and proper patronage from the political leadership which was provided by Prime Minister Modi, and it is also now evident that we have so much of innovative talent even in our rural youth and there is no linkage between formal education degree and innovation capabilities which is evident from the awards given today. He added that this issue was also sought to be addressed by Prime Minister Modi by bringing in National Education Policy 2020 which gives emphasis to skill and not only to the academic degrees and prepares the individual for earning livelihood according to his or her aptitude and skill. The Minister mentioned that the nature of the awards given today and the profile of the awardees proves that a large number of “Grassroot Innovators” are available in India who may not have a very high formal education but who are capable of creating success stories and also generating attractive means of livelihoods for themselves. Dr Jitendra Singh appreciated the efforts of the Department of Science and Technology and National Innovation Foundation (NIF) for organising the “Festival of Innovation & Entrepreneurship” (FINE) and noted that it is a unique effort to promote Science, Technology and Innovation even among those who may not be highly educated in the formal sense or may have not even be science students but who possess inherent talent and inborn aptitude for innovation and entrepreneurship, which also may become a source of livelihood for them. The awards were presented in different categories, namely national level, State level and student category.

India’s Startups and R&D outcomes are setting global benchmarks and are at par with the world. Today the young talent of India, including women via startups or otherwise, are scripting the story of success for a thriving innovation led economy. The Minister said that an enabling atmosphere for innovation was missing in the earlier policy initiatives and political dispensation but now that atmosphere is being provided by the political dispensation led by our Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India is leapfrogging. Dr Jitendra Singh said, the Indian industry is the backbone of the fastest growing large economy of the world and has the potential to revolutionize and bring in a technology movement. Integration of Research, Startups, Academia and Industry is no longer an option but a dire necessity to attract young innovators in the country, he said. The Minister said that ABLE in its 20th year of inception can make significant contribution to develop technologies, products, and providing solutions that help the global community at large. He appreciated ABLE for bringing out a publication, “Enablers of Indian Biotech”, on the occasion of its 20th Anniversary.

In this era of technology where nature of workplace is changing rapidly and where new disruptive technologies is no more limited to a small elite, skill development will be the key to unlocking the true potential of our demography, he added. He expressed his happiness that industry leaders have come together to strengthen the skilling ecosystem as well as to think on ways to leverage new technologies, like AI, IOT for creating future-ready workforce and for larger benefit of society. As outlined by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, India’s capacity will also benefit the globe. National Education Policy (NEP) has created opportunities for learning while earning, he added. The digital lessons include modules on financial and digital literacy, diversity and inclusion, career development, goal setting and entrepreneurship. These are drawn from the upgraded ES curriculum which was launched by the MSDE in September 2022. Aimed at fulfilling the need for anytime, anywhere learning, these modules will be accessible to more than 2.5 million learners through the Government of India’s Bharat Skills Portal as well as other platforms. Developed with active industry contribution, the curriculum includes 12 modules in a bite-sized, gamified format and each lesson is followed by assessments that is designed to help learners assess the depth of their learning. The storytelling approach followed in the modules provides learners with relatable scenarios that they can apply to real-world situations. The constructive feedback system ensures that learners receive feedback that is specific, timely, actionable thus enabling improved learning outcomes. The digital lessons will be instrumental in introducing innovative pedagogical models like blended learning in Industrial Training Institutes (ITI), which will empower educators to create and lead 21st century classrooms. *****\\nNB/AK\\n\"),\n",

The inaugural ceremony was also graced by the august presence of Shri Atul Kumar Tiwari, Secretary, MSDE; Mr R Dinesh, President Designate, CII and Executive Vice-Chairman, TVS Supply Chain Solutions and Mr NSN Murty, Partner, Deloitte. While addressing the gathering, Shri Rajeev Chandrasekhar said that the conference is focusing on intersection of logistics, coastal economies and sustainability and is integral in the context of skilling in coastal economies. He further said that logistics will be an area full of opportunities for young Indians in the coming years, as much as Semiconductors, electronics, and Information technology. It will have huge scope for investment, entrepreneurship and employment. The Minister highlighted that this is an interesting time for the world, representing opportunities and challenges and in this context, India has become the fastest growing nation of the world. And India is being looked upon by the world with lot more respect, he added. Shri Rajeev Chandrasekhar said the world is looking at resilient logistics and trusted supply chains, moving away from risk and moving to trusted resilient economy. With this, the focus and discussion on logistics is important in coastal states like Odisha. Citing the example of mobile phones production the Minister said in 2014, 82% of mobile phones consumed in India were imported, in 2022, almost 100% mobile phones consumed in India are manufactured in India. In 2014, India used to export almost zero mobile phones and this year alone, India has exported Apple phones, Samsung phones made in India to the tune of about 11 billion dollars. One of the arguments for India for many decades has been, that India did not have a viable market and capacity to become a global manufacturing hub as logistics cost of doing business in India was not competitive, today global majors are manufacturing semiconductors,\\xa0 electronics, mobiles and many more products in India, exporting and selling in India as well as the underline logistics ecosystem has become more efficient, he said. He further said that the Narendra Modi government’s programmes like Gati Shakti, National Master Plan for Multi-modal Connectivity, will create modern logistics ecosystem that will help India emerge as a global hub for blue economy products, food, and agricultural products. Emphasizing that the future is about skilling, upskilling and reskilling, the Minister urged the students present at the conference to focus on acquiring skills, as that will increase the prospects of their employability. “As our Hon.

In order to further strengthen this initiative, the Government has recently launched the Aspirational Blocks Programme covering 500 blocks for saturation of essential government services across multiple domains such as health, nutrition, education, agriculture, water resources, financial inclusion, skill development, and basic infrastructure.

The meeting was a pivotal stepping stone towards creating a G20 partnership for actions for women-led development. It involved active participation from 18 participants from 8 G20 countries (Mexico, Saudi Arabia, USA, Japan, South Africa, Turkey, Italy and France), 9 participants from 6 Invitee Countries (Bangladesh, Oman, Spain, UEA, Netherlands and Nigeria) and 9 participants from 6 International Organisations (UN Women, World Bank, IMF, UNICEF, World Trade Organisation and ILO). The intended outcomes proposed by the delegates encompassed all three themes of G20 EMPOWER under the Indian Presidency – Women’s Entrepreneurship: A Win-Win for Equity and Economy, Education: A Game-changing Pathway to Women’s Empowerment, and Creating a Partnership for Promoting Women’s Leadership at all Levels including Grassroots. Underlying all of these has been the power of Digital Technology. This second G20 EMPOWER meeting followed on from the first meeting on 11th and 12th of February 2023, where five Working Groups were set up to deliberate upon Financial Inclusion & Business Acceleration, Mentorship, STEM, Corporate Women Empowerment and Digital Inclusion. With G20 EMPOWER being a partnership between government and the private sector, the working groups developed recommendations for private sector commitments as well as suggested actions for governments. These recommendations comprise of core actions that G20 EMPOWER is envisaged to take to direct women-led development. Delegations held discussions on taking forward the KPIs and adding to the Best Practices Playbook developed under previous presidencies. Under India’s presidency, G20 EMPOWER has discussed a Mentorship Platform which has been proposed to promote women’s leadership at all levels by enhancing and enabling access to mentorship and capacity-building through an e-platform. This would be hosted on the Women’s Empowerment Platform of NITI Aayog, Government of India. It would serve as a global mentoring and capacity-building portal that facilitates structured knowledge-exchange among women mentees and mentors of G20 nations. It will also serve as an aggregator of existing subject-specific mentorship portals targeting areas such as STEM, business leadership, and entrepreneurship. Through the mentorship, networking, knowledge sharing, capacity building and best practices provided through this platform, women entrepreneurs across small, medium and large enterprises as well as grassroots leaders would achieve accelerated success. The gender divide in digital skills, as well as education and skilling more broadly has affected women’s ability to succeed across areas, with this gap being particularly large in case of STEM – which is the field with fastest-growing and highest-paid jobs and entrepreneurial opportunities. G20 EMPOWER’s proposals will seek to bridge these education and skill divides, and subsequently empower adolescent girls and young women with the necessary skills to successfully transition from education to work. In this direction, a Digital Inclusion Platform has been developed as an education and upskilling portal that will enable women across various geographies to get gain digital, technical and financial knowledge that will be crucial for the jobs and entrepreneurship in future. It will be available in 120+international and Indian languages, and serve as an aggregator of global content and courses in the aforementioned areas. It will help guide, provide content, and match women with internships and jobs.'),\n",

Given that some of the most substantial barriers faced by women entrepreneurs are around the availability of credit and market access, G20 EMPOWER has proposed impactful recommendations in these areas. These emphasise sustainable gender-inclusive financial models such as pooled credit funds, credit guarantees, and encouraging gender responsive procurement in government and the private sector through the ‘proudly owned by women’ seal, amongst others. Not only will this create a more vibrant ecosystem of women entrepreneurs, but with women entrepreneurs having higher probability of employing women workers, it would also lead to higher Female Labour Force Participation. Furthermore, G20 EMPOWER’s recommendations envisage a world where the burden of care does not deter women’s economic participation. The care ecosystem found a strong place in the deliberations including those on the availability of subsidized childcare, integrating creches into school systems, and providing nursing rooms/creche facilities at workplaces, amongst others. G20 EMPOWER also recommended that the private sector makes commitments to promote women’s school-to-work transition for adolescent girls and career-development opportunities beyond traditional fields through scholarships, corporate fellowships in STEM, apprenticeships for adolescent girls and young women including in non-conventional vocational areas, as well as apprenticeships for STEM graduates in the R&D sector. Crucially, G20 EMPOWER recognized that women’s participation and representation in decision-making processes at all levels is critical for the prioritization of women’s differential needs and issues in governance, and for localizing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Its initiatives will fill the gaps in skilling, reskilling and upskilling women at all levels including at the grassroots through online platforms, public-private participations, and initiatives for lifelong learning and digital fluency for women and girls especially in scientific and non-traditional sectors. The G20 EMPOWER Pledge was also discussed. India has proposed certain additional provisions to the Pledge to further support advancement of women to leadership positions. Under India’s presidency, the endeavour will be to continue to expand the network of G20 EMPOWER Advocates. Through these and several other commitments and initiatives, the G20 EMPOWER proposals will accelerate the creation of a world where women have the necessary skills, access to resources, supportive infrastructure and environment, and mentorship for a transformational shift towards women-led development. ***\\nSS/AKS\\n'),\n",

The conclave was inaugurated by Vice President of India, Shri Jagdeep Dhankar in the presence of Guest of Honour, Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Shri Anurag Thakur. Over 100 esteemed citizens from various parts of the country who have been mentioned by the Prime Minster in various episodes of “Mann Ki Baat” also attended the event. Four panel discussion sessions highlighting the wide-ranging themes of “Nari Shakti”, “Virasat Ka Uthan”, “Jan Samvad Se Atmanirbharta” and “Ahwan Se Jan Andolan”. The inaugural session was followed by the first and possibly the most significant session on Nari Shakti, a topic which has transcended almost all episodes on ‘Mann Ki Baat’ and is close to the heart of the Prime Minister. The sessions highlighted the transformative impact that Mann Ki Baat has had across the nation in effectively empowering women and bringing them to the forefront of nation building. The Prime Minister has laid emphasis on women-led development as a central dimension of India’s progress and a necessity for strengthening India. In the past nine years, numerous welfare schemes have been launched paving the way to empowering women and making them lead India’s development journey. The discussion was moderated by renowned anchor and host, Ms. Richa Anirudh and the audiences were mesmerised by the eminent panellists such as Ms. Kiran Bedi, IPS (retired) and former Lt. Governor, Puducherry, Ms. Deepa Malik, athlete, Ms. Raveena Tandon, actress, Mr. Dhimant Parekh, Founder and CEO, The Better India, RJ Nitin, Ms. Nikhat Zareen, boxer and Ms. Poorna Malavath, mountaineer. Ms. Malavath, who is the world’s youngest girl to climb Mount Everest in 2014, completed the seven-summit mountaineering challenge in 2022 and was praised by Prime Minister in Mann Ki Baat in June, 2022. Ms. Kiran Bedi, in her opening remarks said if we want this country to see a change, we need to change the mindset of parents and elders because it is this mindset that gets passed on to the children and others in the family. She said that the concept of ‘Paraya Dhan’ needs to be changed as it makes women insecure and we need to give women financial independence and make them self-reliant only then will women feel strong. Ms. Bedi added that parents need to convey the message of equality among children and inculcate similar education and skills. Girls need to feel that they are also responsible towards running the household and taking care of their parents. In conclusion, Ms. Bedi emphasised on three things for women empowerment namely financial independence, education & skills and physically and mentally healthy women for which women need to play sports. Talking about the significance of radio as a forum for change, RJ Nitin said that he strongly believes in radio as an effective medium and has been working in it for 23 years. He added that it is a responsibility of men to ensure women are empowered and if you truly love your mother and sister, then you will work for women empowerment and also ensure that all women are strong enough to find their own opportunities. He said that Radio is a good medium to spread the message far and wide and that is why Prime Minister also chose this medium as this medium has the maximum strength. In closing, he said he is glad to be a part of this and he will ensure that he will make all efforts for women empowerment. Ms. Raveena Tandon talking about arts as a medium of expression and having done movies with strong women characters and women empowering themes said lots of change has come in the industry which was not there in the 90s and earlier decades. She said that time there was a struggle for actors to increase awareness about social causes as it was considered not box office friendly or depressing movies which the audiences’ wont like. Ms. Tandon said that she tried to do as many movies with a positive social message as possible, daman was one such movie which done in 2000 and 23 years later also marital rape is still an issue and that movie got a national award and rightfully so, as it was ahead of its time and we are still discussing these issues. She added that the correction in society has happened. Women are more assimilated in the industry in all kinds of jobs and they have more opportunities as she has sensitivity and understanding of issues. Today in the industry women are paid more than their male counterparts and they rule the TV industry. Even on OTT platforms women rule. The film industry is slowly but surely moving in this direction. She asserted that women have broken the glass ceiling. In the entire world, India has the maximum number of female pilots. In conclusion she said India is still called a developing country but she does not understand why as women in India have gone ahead by leaps and bounds and left the world behind as far as progress in concerned. Taking about radio as a powerful medium and Prime Minister talking about women empowerment in almost all episodes, Ms. Raveena Tandon said “firstly I want to congratulate Prasar Bharti and Modi ji for successfully completing the 100 episodes of Mann Ki Baat”. She said the mass outreach of radio and being a very powerful medium for change, and the way PM talks makes everyone feels like it is their own story. She said that the Prime Minister’s idea of Mann Ki Baat to reach all villages and households especially how PM lauds the true heroes from the grassroots through radio is a genius idea and has been highly successful in touching the heart of each and every Indian. Talking about the selfie with daughters, AWAS yojana and other key schemes, Mr. Dhimant Parekh said, at better India we publish so many positive and inspiring stories and all are led by women and the entire team is women led. He asserted that to bring change we need two things, inspiration and awareness and Mann Ki Baat has brought these two things beautifully together. Mann Ki Baat has inspired us and made us aware about what we can do. Talking about Open Defecation & sanitation, he said that PM spoke about a women who got married and realised that there were no toilets in the entire village where she got, she got all women to come together and petitioned and got 75 toilets constructed in her village and she did not stop there she went back to her maternal village and got more toilets constructed there so she improved two villages and that is true women empowerment and Nari Shakti which shows how inspiration is so important and that is what Mann Ki Baat has been doing so successfully. Ms. Nikhat Zareen, talking about her meeting with the Prime Minister said that when she won gold in the world championship and got invited by PM Modi, she had only seen him through TV or social media but when she met him, the Hon’ble PM was so casual and calm that she did not feel as if she is talking to the PM but it felt as if she is talking to some elder from her own family. She said that “My father was the support behind my boxing, and PM fulfilled my wish for a selfie and I met him again after commonwealth championship and gifted him boxing gloves as a token of appreciation, meeting the Prime Minister was a good experience and inspiration as she comes from a village and it was a great motivator.”\\nElaborating on how Prime minister not just supports the winners but also motivates and inspires the sportspersons who lose, Ms. Zareen said “when I got injured, I was out of boxing for one year and people started saying I will not be able to make a comeback and my career was over but my family supported me and I made the comeback.” She added “Uggtey hue suraj ko sab salaam kartey hai but our hon’ble Prime Minister motivates and inspires us at all times, winning or losing is not important and PM keeps motivating inspiring and asking us to keep playing. This is a big quality in the Prime Minister.”\\n\\nMs. Poorna Malavath, who climbed Mount Everest at an age of 13 years said “I never expected I will be able to climb the highest mountain in the world and then meeting the Prime Minister of India was also completely unexpected. I came from a small town and it was a great moment of my life to meet Prime Minister for almost an hour and he spoke to me in such a friendly manner like a family member and was highly motivating and I got great support from him.” She added “I want to thank Modiji for making such a big impact to my life. I am a tribal girl from a poor background, my parents are farmers and opportunities are less but now people know me because I met the Prime Minister and there has been a huge change in my life.” Ms. Malavath asserted that now she is encouraging more girls and made a profession out of her passion and now she is training and encouraging youngsters and expanding this adventure throughout India. Ms. Deepa Malik is an inspiration for all in India, and is the first female para-athlete to win an Olympic medal in 2016. Highlighting the importance of the change in the mindset of the masses simply by using the word ‘divyang’ instead of ‘Viklang’ which was propagated by the Prime Minister in Mann Ki Baat, She said “It was my pleasure to meet Prime Minister Modi at ‘Chai Pe Charcha’ and PM remembered each and every word of our discussion and heard our Mann Ki baat and said let us focus on abilities over disabilities.” PM through Mann Ki Baat urged all to use the word ‘divyangs’. She asserted that “when PM says something the entire country listens and he makes a deep change in the entire country.” Ms. Malik played out a one minute clip of the Prime Minister’s Mann Ki Baat wherein PM said that she has defeated her disabled by winning the medal and this is so powerful, it shows their willpower and talent. Ms. Malik stated that women empowerment has been promoted a lot through MKB and especially for divyangs. Ms. Nikhat Zareen highlighted that Khelo India has made a big change to sports in India as financial support is very important and Khelo India has provided this support to all athletes and especially women athletes who have progressed in sports and made records. She said “Women also inspire others to work harder and play harder.” Talking about the TOP (Target Olympic Podium) scheme, she said “it is very important for all athletes and the support we get though it inspires us to work harder and get more medals for the nation.”\\nMs. Raveena Tandon also talked about being a part of Women20 under the umbrella G20 and said her experience has been excellent and the brainstorming and agenda setting for policy making has been an enriching experience. She added “Women at the grassroot level need to be given an impetus through financial empowerment. This is a country where Nari Shakti was prayed to like a goddess like Chandi, Kali Durga and now we have pilots, bankers, technocrats, sports women, and these are our Nari Shakti.”. She also said “Environment and global warming is close to my heart and women lead the way towards recycling and sustainability and women are the ones that take the society forward and they should spread this light as much as possible as they are very powerful in any role they play”. ******\\nAS\\n'),\n",

Together, the G20 members represent more than 80 percent of the world’s GDP, 75% of international trade and 60% of the world population. Given its key role in the global economy, the G20 holds a strategic role in securing future global economic growth and prosperity. It also has a huge potential to deliver on women’s empowerment and gender equality. The G20 Alliance for the Empowerment and Progression of Women’s Economic Representation (EMPOWER) is an alliance of G20 business leaders and governments that aims to accelerate women’s leadership and empowerment in the private sector.

Speaking as chief guest at the Youth 20 Consultation on ‘Peace-building and Reconciliation: Ushering in an Era of No War’ at the University of Jammu, Dr Jitendra Singh said that three generations have passed since Independence and there was no dearth of talent or capabilities but the favourable milieu was lacking which has now been made available by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. So this is a great opportunity but at the same time also a challenge and privilege because the same youth will be deciding the face of India@2047. Those who are thirty today will be the prime citizens, he said. Dr Jitendra Singh said that 2023 is a very important year for the country as India is holding the G20 presidency. In this auspicious year, one can confidently say that Prime Minister Modi has given a model of governance which is sustainable, which defies the principle of diminishing returns and which grows stronger with each new challenge. The Minister said that just after forming the Government in May 2014, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi had said that this Government will be dedicated towards the upliftment of the poor, empowerment of women and the betterment of the youth. He added that on the evening of 26th May 2014 when Narendra Modi was sworn in as Prime Minister, I said this is the beginning of the journey from pessimism to optimism. So when the Prime Minister said that his government would give high priority to youth, many people treated it with cynicism. But today when you look back, as the government is completing 9 years under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, you can reasonably say with evidence that Prime Minister has walked the talk and also led his team to walk the talk. The Minister recalled that soon after the Government came to power in May 2014, a large number of transformational changes have been introduced. Most of the functioning has been converted online and in order to bring in transparency, accountability and citizen participation, the human interface has been reduced to the bare minimum. This highlights the fact that now there is a government that is ready to trust the youth of this country. Talking about grievance redressal, Dr. Jitendra Singh said that the grievance redressal mechanism was shifted to CPGRAMS as a result of which about 20 lakh grievances are received every year in comparison to just 2 lakhs every year before this government came in because this government followed a policy of time bound redressal and gained the confidence of the people. It was Prime Minister Modi, said Dr Jitendra Singh, who had, a few months ago, promised the nation that he would soon provide 10 lakh government jobs for the youth. Once again, the Minister said, it is evident that Prime Minister Modi does what he says and he has the capacity to make everything “Mumkin” (possible). Dr Jitendra Singh said, right from the beginning, Prime Minister Modi has given highest priority to the issues and concerns related to youth. He said, Prime Minister has constantly sought to create new avenues and opportunities for livelihood, government jobs and income for the youth. Dr Jitendra Singh referred to the India’s Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, which the Modi government amended after 30 years in 2018 to introduce a number of new provisions including criminalising the act of giving bribe also in addition to taking bribe; and at the same time putting in place an effective deterrence for such actions by individuals as well as corporate entities. Dr Jitendra Singh recalled that it was Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi who, in his Independence Day address of 2015, gave a call for “StartUp India StandUp India”, which soon turned into a countrywide movement. The result of this is that now the number of StartUps in India has gone up from 300 - 400 in 2014 to more than 75,000 today and India ranks third in the world in StartUp ecosystem, he added. Moreover the number of Biotech StartUps in the country has increased from 50 to over 5,000 in the last 8 years, because of the support and enabling milieu provided by Prime Minister Narendra Modi ever since he took over in 2014. It is expected to cross the figure of 10,000 by 2025. The Minister said that Himalayan states including Uttarakhand have become the fountainhead for aromatic start-ups. Moreover he said that “Purple Revolution” or Aroma Mission is Jammu & Kashmir’s contribution to StartUp India. It is pertinent to mention that Aroma Mission is attracting StartUps and agriculturists from across the country. More than 44,000 persons have been trained and several crores of farmers’ revenue generated so far. Similarly Dr. Jitendra Singh said, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given the highest priority to the growth and development of the North Eastern region and it was a path-breaking decision under his leadership to exempt home grown bamboo from the purview of the 100 year old Indian Forest Act. This helped in bringing ease of doing business in the bamboo sector for the young entrepreneurs, he said. Earlier governments never cared to explore India’s vast ocean resources and it is for the first time, after Shri Narendra Modi took over as Prime Minister that there is a serious effort to explore and harness the ocean resources and give priority to the Blue Economy of India\\nIn the field of conventional education, at the start of 2014, there were 725 universities and now 300 more have been added in the past 9 years at the rate of 1 new university every week. The Minister said that 145 medical colleges were opened in the country between 2004 and 2014. More than 260 medical colleges have been opened during 2014 to 2022 at the rate of 1 college of medicine per day and at the rate of 2 degree colleges per day so that every youth get accessibility to education. He/she should not be deprived of receiving education simply because it’s not available, he added. The Minister recalled that recently Central University of Jammu has opened North India’s first teaching department of space. Dr Jitendra Singh mentioned that we are already a part of the global world. And therefore if we have to live up to global benchmarks, we have to prepare ourselves for global challenges and we have to also address the global concerns be it climate change, clean energy etc. Prime Minister Modi, in his Independence Day speech, had introduced us to the potential of green hydrogen as a fuel. India in the near future will be one of the major exporters of green hydrogen. The Minister said that Youth20 is one of the eight official engagement groups under the G20 umbrella. It is an attempt to create a connecting point between G20 governments and their local youth. The Y20 India Summit in 2023 will exemplify India’s youth-centric efforts and provide an opportunity to showcase its values and policy measures to the youth across the globe. The Minister concluded by saying that because of all this, the onus lies on the youth of today, those who are in their thirties and who are going to be the prime citizens in 2047. How best they can use this opportunity depends on them. He said he hoped that the youth at that time will be able to say that “I’m the architect of India@100” and therefore we of the earlier generation have the responsibility to induce that capacity building of the youth of today, he concluded. Vice Chancellor Jammu University, Sh. Rai said, Jammu and Kashmir has always been the “centre of knowledge’’ and further stated that various schemes have been launched to empower the youth like Mission Youth that focus on livelihood generation, skill development, recreational and social engagement, education counselling, Himayat Mission, Tejasvi Scheme for women, and many more. 17 Youth delegates from G20 countries like Indonesia, South Africa, Russia and Republic of Korea, and other international countries like Nigeria, Ghana, Iran, Madagascar, Afghanistan, Malawi participated in the two-day Y20 Consultation at University of Jammu in Jammu, Jammu and Kashmir. 25 national delegates from different universities across India also participated in the Y20 Consultation.

NFRA will share its recommendations to Ministry of Corporate Affairs, after which Ind AS 117 has to be considered and notified by the Central Government under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015. When notified, it will replace currently notified Ind AS 104, Insurance Contracts. IFRS 17, originally issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), in May 2017, is a complete overhaul of the accounting for the Insurance Industry. It is considered as a first truly international IFRS Standard for insurance contracts to help investors and other users to better understand insurers’ risk exposure, profitability and financial position. Globally, it has become effective from 1st January 2023. IFRS 17 is specifically designed to capture the unique features of the insurance and investment contracts of the Insurance Entities. It is highly insurance products specific and would entail a paradigm shift in the measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements.'),\n",

IASB’s factsheet of 2017 says with $13 trillion in assets, insurers account for 12 per cent of the total assets of listed companies that use IFRS Standards. Given the central economic role of the industry, proper and transparent accounting for insurance contracts is of crucial importance. Dr Ajay Bhushan Prasad Pandey highlighted a number of reforms in India in recent times and India’s prominent role in the global affairs. Dr Pandey said that Ind AS 117 is substantially converged with IFRS Standard adopted in over 140 countries. This decision is in line with the India’s policy to embrace international best practices to enable level playing field to the Indian Companies. This standard will enable Indian Insurance Industry to present globally comparable financial information which augurs well for enhanced investment in the sector needed for increasing the insurance penetration in the country. Prior to this meeting, NFRA also held an outreach with members from Life Insurance Industry as part of its examination of the proposed new standard on Insurance Contracts in February 2023 in which IRDAI also participated. The members from the Life Insurance Industry provided valuable insights to the proposed Ind AS 117 and expressed need for early notification of the standard. ICAI had also undertaken extensive public consultation by issuing exposure drafts of the proposed Ind AS 117 in 2018, 2021 and 2022. ****\\nPPG/KMN\\n'),\n",

Through this partnership with UNCDF, we aim to facilitate cross-border engagement, knowledge exchange, and investments to support high-impact Agri-Tech innovations and make agriculture practices efficient, resilient, and sustainable for smallholder farmers across developing economies. We look forward to working with our partners to realize this vision.”\\nAt the launch, Jaspreet Singh, Global lead, Financial health and Innovation, UNCDF, said, “The learnings from the Agri-tech challenge have been immense and revealed that the market is enormous and has immense potential for global south-south collaboration. Moving forward, we are working towards creating a community platform for smallholder farmers which can be helpful for Agri and Agri-tech startups to exchange ideas, explore collaboration, and share knowledge”\\nWith over 70% of the agricultural workforce in India comprising smallholder farmers, Agri-tech start-ups have emerged as the solution to the challenges faced by farmers. AIM, in partnership with UNCDF, aims to create a south-south collaboration environment where start-ups from Asia and Africa can exchange ideas and generate opportunities in their respective countries. AIM, an anchor partner of the south-south collaboration initiatives, collaborates with partner countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Kenya, Uganda, Malawi, and Zambia. The collaboration focuses on addressing three key challenges in the agriculture sector, namely low productivity, poor risk resilience, and inefficient supply chain management. Out of 25 potential Agri-Tech start-ups that aim to solve critical challenges around production, supply chain, risk, and climate change, the partners have shown interest in and are at various stages of cross-border engagement. The Agri-Tech start-ups in emerging economies have successfully provided digital solutions to several agricultural challenges that the sector has faced in the past. AIM, in partnership with UNCDF, is committed to supporting high-impact Agri-Tech innovations, creating an enabling environment that facilitates start-up growth and sharing of knowledge across borders. The Indian start-up sector has the potential to play the role of a knowledge hub and support market development in less-developed start-up economies across the globe. The launch of the whitepaper marks a significant milestone in the journey towards making India a global leader in Agri-Tech innovation and expanding these innovations to the least developed countries in Asia and Africa. AIM, NITI Aayog, and UNCDF are committed to working together towards this goal and achieving sustainable and inclusive growth in the agriculture sector. ***\\nDS\\n'),\n",

The President said that the North-Eastern Region is possibly the best example of how various communities have lived together historically. As a result, it has rich ethnic and linguistic diversity. In such a region, institutions need to have a great deal of sensitivity and responsibility, as divergent traditions and laws govern the lives of the people of the region. The legislations applicable to different areas may vary, but the entire area is administered by a common High Court. She said that it is heartening to see that the Gauhati High Court continues to uphold the customary laws that have been in practice in some of the states under its jurisdiction. By respecting the sentiments of the indigenous people, this institution has helped enhance the ethos of peaceful coexistence in this region. Speaking about environmental degradation, the President said that in our time, we must become sensitive to ecological justice. Environmental degradation has led to great injustice to many communities around the world. We need to be sensitive to other species as well as towards the whole ecology, because humankind as a whole has done unprecedented damage, that is, injustice to the other members of Mother Nature’s family. She said that working towards ecological justice can take many forms. She expressed confidence that the legal fraternity would also make meaningful contributions to it. The President said that justice, by definition, has to be inclusive, and thus must be accessible to all. However, access to justice is hindered by many factors. Cost of justice is one of them. She said that we need to keep expanding the reach of free legal counselling. She noted that the language of justice is another hindrance, but there is praiseworthy progress in that direction and the higher judiciary has started making verdicts available in more and more regional languages. She said that the increasing role of technology in the administration of justice has been solving many problems that had affected the system for long. She urged lawyers and students of law to find technological solutions in the legal domain that can provide a helping hand to the poor and the needy.

Therefore, protecting elephants is an important part of our national responsibility to preserve our national heritage. The President said that the actions which are in the interest of nature, animals and birds, are also in the interest of humanity and Mother Earth.

They are also social animals like humans. She said that we should have the same sense of sympathy and respect for elephants and other living beings as we have for humans. She added that we can learn the feeling of selfless love from animals and birds. The President said that the 'Human-Elephant Conflict' has been an issue for centuries. And when we analyze this conflict, it is found that a barrier created in the natural habitat or movement of elephants is the root cause. Therefore, the responsibility of this conflict lies with the human society. She noted that protecting elephants, conserving their natural habitats and keeping elephant corridors free from obstruction are the main objectives of Project Elephant. Solving the problems related to Human-Elephant Conflict is also the aim of this project. She said that all these objectives are related to each other. The President said that Kaziranga and Manas National Parks of Assam are invaluable heritage not only of India but of the whole world. That is why these have been given the status of 'World Heritage Site' by UNESCO. She noted that Assam has the second largest population of wild elephants in the country. Therefore Kaziranga is a very apt place for organizing the Gaj-Utsav. She emphasized that for the success of Project Elephant and Gaj-Utsav, all the stakeholders would have to move forward together.

It is incumbent upon them to continue to uphold the ideals of the Constitution and work with integrity and commitment towards nation building. Speaking about the digitisation of the audit process, the President said that the recent launch of the One Indian Audit & Accounts Department One System is a praiseworthy initiative. Technologies such as blockchains, data analytics, virtual audit rooms etc. can be used widely for ensuring transparency and compliance. But technology cannot and should not replace the need for human intervention. She urged young officers to understand the value of human touch and sensitivity towards issues concerning the nation and its citizens, while taking decisions and implementing policies. The President said that the primary objective of the audit should be to improve the processes and policies rather than to be a fault-finding exercise. Therefore, it is essential to communicate the audit recommendations with clarity and conviction.

By adopting the best practices of one Panchayat in other Panchayats, we can quickly develop and make our villages prosperous. The President said that there is a provision for the election of Panchayat representatives, every five years, to ensure the participation of every section of society. However, it has been observed that these elections sometimes create bitterness among the people. Keeping in mind the need to avoid any mutual discord among the villagers due to the elections, Panchayat elections have been kept separate from political parties. She said that in a society where there is mutual cooperation and trust among people, flourishes more. She said that a village is an extension of family. All community work should be done with mutual agreement as much as possible. The President said that for the holistic development of any society, the participation of women is very important.

Private Hospitals situated in the States may also directly procure such Vaccines from the manufacturer These vaccines once procured may be administered as per the existing Covid vaccination guidelines. After the detailed presentation, Dr. P.K. Mishra highlighted that for managing localized surges it is essential that sufficient health infrastructure should be available at sub-district level and the same may be ensured in consultation with States. He further exhorted that the advisories for guiding States should be assessed based on evolving scenario and updated accordingly. Further, the attendees deliberated that it is critical to focus on identification of emerging hotspots and States should monitor trends of ILI/SARI cases, send sufficient samples for testing of Covid-19, and ramp up of Whole Genome Sequencing. Dr. P.K. Mishra stressed that the time tested 5-fold strategy of Test-Track-Treat-Vaccination & adherence COVID Appropriate Behaviour must continue to be implemented and equally crucial to promote awareness within community regarding COVID appropriate behaviour and caution citizens against complacency. He advised officials to maintain a strict vigil on the Covid-19 situation and take necessary actions to contain the COVID-19 spread. ********\\n\\nDS/ST\\n'),\n",

Best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Ganga-Pushkaralu festival! Since all of you have come to Kashi, you all are personally my guests on this visit; and we believe that a guest is akin to God. Even though I could not be present there to welcome you due to some pre-occupations, but I wish I could be amidst you all. I congratulate the Kashi-Telugu Committee and my Parliamentary colleague G.V.L Narasimha Rao ji for this event. This Ganga-Pushkaralu festival at the ghats of Kashi is like the confluence of the Ganga and the Godavari. It is a celebration of the confluence of ancient civilizations, cultures and traditions of India. You might remember that a few months back, the Kashi-Tamil Sangamam was organized here on the land of Kashi. Just a few days ago, I had the privilege of participating in the Saurashtra-Tamil Sangamam. I had said at that time, this 'Azadi Ka Amritkaal' is the confluence of diversities and different streams of the country. The nectar of nationalism is oozing out of this confluence of diversities, which will keep India vibrant till the infinite future. Friends,\\n\\nEveryone associated with Kashi knows that Kashi and its people have a deep connection with the Telugu people. As soon as a Telugu person arrives in Kashi, the people of Kashi feel that a member of their own family has arrived. The people of Kashi have been welcoming you all for generations. This relationship is as ancient as Kashi. The devotion of Telugu people towards Kashi is as sacred as Kashi itself. Even today, people from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana alone constitute a significant proportion of the number of pilgrims visiting Kashi. Telugu region has given Kashi so many great saints, so many Acharyas and sages. When the people of Kashi and the pilgrims go to visit Baba Vishwanath, they also visit Tailang Swami's ashram to seek his blessings. Swami Ramakrishna Paramhansa used to call Tailang Swami the living Shiva of Kashi. You are already aware that Tailanga Swami was born in Vizianagaram. There have been several great souls like Jiddu Krishnamurti, who are remembered even today in Kashi. Brothers and Sisters,\\n\\nJust as Kashi adopted and embraced the Telugu people, similarly the Telugu people have kept Kashi close to their hearts. Even the holy shrine Vemulawada is also known as Dakshina Kashi. The black thread that is tied on the hands in the temples of Andhra and Telangana is still called Kashi Daram. Similarly, be it the Kasikhandamu treatise of Srinath Mahakavi, the Kashi Yatra character of Engul Veeraswamayya, or the popular Kashi Majili Kathalu, Kashi and the glory of Kashi is equally & deeply embedded in the Telugu language and Telugu literature. If an outsider sees all this, it would be difficult for him to believe that how can a city so far away be so close to the heart! But this is the heritage and tradition of India which has kept the belief of 'Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat' alive for centuries. Friends,\\n\\nKashi is also the city of liberation and salvation. There was a time when Telugu people used to walk thousands of kilometres to come to Kashi. They used to face several obstacles in their journey. In modern times, those circumstances are changing rapidly. Today on one hand there is the divine splendour of Vishwanath Dham, and on the other hand there is the grandeur of the ghats of Ganga. Today there are streets of Kashi on one hand, and a network of new roads and highways on the other. People from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana who have come to Kashi earlier must be experiencing the change taking place in Kashi. There was a time when it used to take hours to reach Dashashwamedh Ghat from the airport. Today, due to the construction of a new highway, people are saving a lot of time. There was a time when the streets of Kashi were full of dangling electric wires. Now the electric wires are laid underground in most of the places in Kashi. Today, be it the many kunds of Kashi, or the pathways leading to the temples, or be it the cultural places of Kashi, everything is being revamped. Now even boats with CNG have started plying in river Ganga. And that day is not too far when people visiting Banaras will also get the facility of ropeway. Be it the Swachhata Abhiyan or the cleanliness of the Ghats of Kashi, the people and the youth of Banaras have made it a mass movement. The people of Kashi have done this with their hard work. They have put a lot of effort. So, I can't\\xa0praise and appreciate the people of Kashi enough through this programme! And friends,\\n\\nI will also say with full confidence that my people of Kashi will leave no stone unturned to serve and greet you. Baba's blessings, the darshan of Kalabhairav and Maa Annapurna is splendid in itself. Just a dip in Ganga ji will make your soul blissful. Besides this, there is also 'Kashi ki lassi' and 'thandai' for you to savour this summer. The taste of Banaras ki Chaat, Litti-Chokha, and Banarasi Paan will make your trip even more memorable. And I will make one more request to you. Like the wooden Etikoppaka toys are famous in your place, similarly Banaras is also famous for wooden toys. Our friends from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana can take back with them wooden Banarasi toys, Banarasi sarees, Banarasi sweets, and many such things. These things will increase your joy manifold. Friends,\\nOur forefathers had established the essence of India in different centres, which completed the form of Mother India. If there is Baba Vishwanath in Kashi, there is Mallikarjuna in Andhra and Lord Raj-Rajeshwar in Telangana. If Kashi has Vishalakshi Shaktipeeth, Andhra has Maa Bhramaramba, and Telangana has Raj-Rajeshwari. All such sacred places are important centres of India and hold its cultural identity. We must see this diversity of the country in totality. Only then will we be able to know our perfection; and only then will we be able to awaken our full potential. I am sure that festivals like Ganga-Pushkaralu will continue to take forward this resolution of national service. With this expectation, I once again wish you all the very best! May this journey of yours be fruitful, comfortable and fill your mind with divinity by taking back new memories from Kashi. This is what I pray for at Baba's feet. Once again, my heartiest thanks to all of you. DISCLAIMER: This is the approximate translation of PM’s speech. Original speech was delivered in Hindi. ***\\nDS/VJ/IG/AK\\n\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'English_rendering_of_PMs_address_at_the_.txt', 'Ministry': 'Prime_Ministers_Office', 'Month': 'Apr23html'}, page_content=\"English rendering of PM's address at the National Rozgar Mela\\n\\n\\nNamaskar ! Friends,\\n\\n\\nToday is the auspicious festival of Baisakhi. I congratulate all the countrymen on the occasion of Baisakhi. On this joyous festival today, more than 70 thousand youngsters have got government jobs in various departments of the central government. My heartiest congratulations to all the youngsters like you and your family members! I extend my best wishes for your bright future. Friends,\\n\\n\\nOur government is committed to providing the right opportunities to the talent and zeal of the youth to fulfil the vision of a developed India. Besides the initiative of the central government, the process of providing government jobs is going on at a rapid pace in all NDA and BJP-ruled states from Gujarat to Assam and UP to Maharashtra. Yesterday, appointment letters were handed over to more than 22 thousand teachers in Madhya Pradesh. This National Rozgar Mela is also a proof of our commitment towards the youth. Friends,\\n\\n\\nToday India is the fastest growing economy in the world. The whole world is facing recession after Covid. The economy of most of the countries is continuously slumping. But amidst all this, the world is viewing India as a 'bright spot'. Today's New India, with the new policies and strategies which are now being followed, has opened the doors of new possibilities and new opportunities in the country. There was a time when India used to work with a reactive approach in terms of technology or infrastructure. Since 2014, India has adopted a proactive approach. As a result, this third decade of the 21st century is creating opportunities for employment and self-employment, which could not even be imagined earlier. Today, many such sectors have opened up in front of the youth, which never existed 10 years back. We have the example of startups in front of us. Today there is tremendous enthusiasm among the youth of India regarding startups. According to a report, startups have created more than 40 lakh direct and indirect jobs. So is the drone industry. Today, be it in the agriculture sector, defence sector, surveys related to infrastructure or the Swamitva scheme, the demand for drones is increasing continuously. That's why many youngsters are joining the fields of drone manufacturing and drone flying. You must also have seen how the country's sports sector has been revived in the last 8-9 years. Today, new stadiums are being built across the country and new academies are being opened up. There is a need for coaches, technicians and support staff. Doubling the sports budget in the country is also creating new opportunities for the youth. Friends,\\n\\n\\nThe thinking and approach of Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan is much more than just adopting 'Swadeshi' and 'Vocal for Local'. This is not a matter of limited scope. The 'Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan' is a campaign to generate crores of new employment opportunities in India from villages to cities. Today, everything from modern satellites to semi-high-speed trains are being manufactured in India itself. In the last 8-9 years, more than 30 thousand new and safe LHB coaches have been made in the country. The thousands of tonnes of steel used in their construction, the different products used have created thousands of new employment opportunities in the entire supply chain. I will also give you an example of India's toy industry. Jitendra Singh ji also mentioned about it. For decades, children in India played with toys imported from abroad. Neither the quality of these toys was good, nor were these toys made keeping Indian children in mind. But nobody ever paid attention to it. We fixed quality parameters for imported toys and started promoting our indigenous industry. As a result, within 3-4 years, the toy industry was revived, and many new employment opportunities were created. Another approach which dominated the defence sector in our country for decades was that defence equipment could only be imported. These equipment could be brought only from abroad. We did not trust the manufacturers of our country. Our government has also changed this approach. Our forces have prepared a list of more than 300 such equipment and weapons, which will now be manufactured in India and will be procured from the Indian industry. Today India exports defence equipment worth Rs 15 thousand crores to foreign countries. This has created thousands of employment opportunities.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'English_rendering_of_PMs_address_at_the_.txt', 'Ministry': 'Prime_Ministers_Office', 'Month': 'Apr23html'}, page_content=\"Friends,\\n\\n\\nYou should never forget one more thing. When the country gave us the opportunity to serve in 2014, most of the mobile phones sold in India used to be imported. We gave incentives to increase local production. Had the pre-2014 situation prevailed today we would have spent lakhs of crores of rupees on foreign exchange. But now, we are not only catering to the domestic needs but also exporting mobile phones, delivering to the other countries of the world. Consequently, thousands of new employment opportunities have also been created. Friends,\\n\\n\\nThere is another side of employment generation, and that is the investment made by the government in infrastructure projects. Our government is known for the fast pace of work in infrastructure projects. When the government spends on capital expenditure, a wide variety of infrastructure such as roads, railways, ports and new buildings are created. In infrastructure development, not only human resources like engineers, technicians, accountants, labourers are required but also all types of equipment, and steel, cement and many such things are required. During our government's regime, there has been a four-fold increase in capital expenditure in the last 8-9 years. As a result, both new employment opportunities and income of the people have increased. Let me give you the example of Indian Railways. In the seven decades prior to 2014, around 20,000 kilometres of rail lines were electrified. In the last 9 years, we have completed the electrification of about 40 thousand kilometres of railway lines. Before 2014, only 600 metres of new metro lines were constructed in a month, just 600 metres! Today, we are laying new metro lines of about 6 kilometres every month. At that time, the calculation was done in metres, but today the calculation is being done in kilometres. In 2014, less than 70 districts had gas network expansion in the country. Today this number has increased to 630 districts. Compare\\xa070 districts with the 630 districts! Till 2014, the length of roads in rural areas was just less than 4 lakh km. Today this figure has also increased to more than 7.25 lakh kilometres. You can imagine the kind of impact it has when the roads connect with the villages. Due to this, employment starts to generate at a rapid pace in the entire ecosystem. Friends,\\n\\n\\nSimilar work has been done in the aviation sector of the country. Till 2014 there were 74 airports in the country, today it has increased to 148. We all know the kind of staff that is needed in airport operations. So, you would have probably guessed that these many new airports have also created thousands of new opportunities in the country. And you have seen that recently Air India has placed an order to buy a record number of airplanes. Many other Indian companies will also follow suit. That is, in the coming days, a large number of new opportunities will be created in this sector from catering to inflight services, from maintenance to on-ground handling. Similar progress is also taking place in our port sector. With the development of the sea coast and the development of our ports, the cargo handling at our ports has doubled as compared to before, and the time taken for this has now been halved. This major change has also created a large number of new opportunities in the port sector. Friends,\\n\\n\\nThe health sector of the country is also turning into a great example of the employment generation. India had less than 400 medical colleges in 2014, but today there are 660 medical colleges. In 2014, the number of undergraduate medical seats was around 50 thousand only but today more than 1 lakh seats are available. Today, we are getting double the number of doctors who pass the examination. Due to the Ayushman Bharat scheme, many new hospitals and clinics have been set up in the country. That is, every infrastructure related project is ensuring growth in generating employment and self-employment. Friends,\\n\\n\\nTo give a boost to the rural economy, the government is creating FPOs, providing financial assistance of lakhs of crores of rupees to Self Help Groups, expanding storage capacity, creating employment opportunities for the youth within their own villages. Since 2014, more than 3 lakh new common service centres have been set up in the country. Since 2014, more than 6 lakh kilometres of optical fibre has been laid in the villages of the country. Since 2014, more than three crore houses have been built and given to the poor in the country. Out of these, more than 2.5 crore houses have been built in villages alone. In the past few years, several projects like more than 10 crore toilets, more than 1.5 lakh health and wellness centres, and thousands of new panchayat buildings in villages have given work and employment opportunities to lakhs of youngsters in the villages. Today, farm mechanization has developed rapidly in the agriculture sector. So, new employment opportunities are being created in the villages due to this as well. Friends,\\n\\n\\nToday, the way India is hand holding its small-scale industries and promoting entrepreneurship ensures the creation of a large number of jobs. Recently Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana has completed 8 years. In these 8 years, loans worth Rs 23 lakh crore have been given without bank guarantee under Mudra Yojana. Out of this, 70 percent of the loans have been given to women. This scheme has created 8 crore new entrepreneurs; that is, these are the people who have started their businesses for the first time with the help of Mudra Yojana. The success of Mudra Yojana has encouraged crores of people of the country for self-employment and has shown a new direction. And friends, I want to tell you one more thing. In these 8-9 years, we have seen the importance of micro finance in strengthening the economy at the grassroots level. Even the stalwarts who consider themselves to be big economists and the people who have the habit of giving loans to big business owners on the phone, never understood the power of micro finance before. Even today these people are mocking micro finance. They do not understand the potential of the common man of the country. Friends,\\nI would like to specially give some suggestions to those who have received the appointment letters today. Some of you are joining the railways, while some are joining the education sector. Some people are getting the opportunity to offer their services to banks. This is your opportunity to contribute to the development of the country. The country will celebrate 100 years of independence in 2047 and is moving forward with the aim of becoming a developed India. And I know that your age today is the golden age (Amritkaal) for you. In these 25 years of your life, the country is going to move forward at a very rapid pace and you are going to contribute to that journey. You can imagine that in such a wonderful period, with such a wonderful opportunity, today you are taking a new responsibility on your shoulders to take the country forward. Your every step and every moment of your time is going to be useful in making the country develop at a faster pace. Today you may be starting your journey as a government employee. In this journey, one should always remember those things and always view yourself as the common man. For the last 5 years, 10 years, what did you feel as a citizen? Which behaviour of the government used to frustrate you? Which behaviour of the government did you like? You must also keep this in your mind that whatever bad experiences you have been through, you will not allow any of the citizens to go through that bad experience while you are serving. What has happened to you will not happen to anyone else because you are there; and this is a great service. Now it is your responsibility that after joining the government service, you fulfil those expectations of others. Make yourself fit. Each one of you can influence and inspire the life of a common man in one way or the other through your work. He can be saved from drowning in the pool of despair. Friends, what could be a greater work for humanity than this? You should try to ensure that your work has a positive impact and your work improves the life of a common man so that his confidence and trust in the government systems increase. I have one more request to all of you. All of you have achieved this success through hard work. But don't let the learning process stop even after getting a government job. The willingness to know and learn something new will bring about a positive impact on both your work and personality. You can upgrade your skills by joining the online learning platform iGoT Karmayogi. And friends I always say and believe that 'never let your inner student die'. I never work with the illusion that I am a great scholar or I know everything or have learned everything. I don't have\\xa0 such an illusion. I always consider myself a student and try to learn from everyone. You also keep your inner student alive, keep trying to learn something new and this attitude will open up new doors of opportunities in your life. Friends,\\nWhat could be better than celebrating this auspicious festival of Baisakhi and starting a new chapter of life at the same time. Once again, my best wishes to all of you for your bright future. Once again my heartiest congratulations to all of you! DISCLAIMER: This is the approximate translation of PM’s speech.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'English_rendering_of_PMs_Inaugural_addre.txt', 'Ministry': 'Prime_Ministers_Office', 'Month': 'Apr23html'}, page_content=\"English rendering of PM's Inaugural address at the Global Buddhist Summit, Delhi\\n\\n\\nNamo Buddhaya! Members of the Union Cabinet present in the program Shri Kiren Rijiju ji, G. Kishan Reddy ji, Arjun Ram Meghwal ji, Meenakshi Lekhi ji, Secretary General of the International Buddhist Confederation, all the respected monks who came from India and abroad, other Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen! All of you have come from different parts of the world to attend the inaugural Global Buddhist Summit. The tradition of this land of Buddha is- 'Atithi Devo Bhava'! That is, guests are like gods to us. But, when so many personalities, who have lived through Lord Buddha’s ideals, are in front of us, we feel the presence of Buddha around us. Buddha is beyond the individual, it is a perception. Buddha is a thought that transcends the individual. Buddha is a thought that transcends form and Buddha is a consciousness beyond manifestation. This Buddha consciousness is eternal, ceaseless. This thought is eternal. This realization is distinctive. This is the reason why today people from so many different countries and from so many different geographical and cultural environments are present here. This is the expansion of Lord Buddha, which binds the entire humanity in a single thread. We can imagine this power of crores of followers of Buddha in different countries of the world that when they take a resolution together, how limitless their energy becomes. When so many people work together with one idea for a better future for the world, the future is bound to be monumental. And therefore, I believe the first Global Buddhist Summit will create an effective platform for the efforts of all our countries in this direction. I heartily congratulate the Ministry of Culture of India and the International Buddhist Confederation for organizing this event. Friends,\\nThere is another reason for my intimate attachment to this summit. Vadnagar in Gujarat, where I was born, has a deep association with Buddhism. Many archaeological evidences related to Buddhism have been found in Vadnagar. Once, Buddhist traveller Hiuen Tsang also visited Vadnagar. And all the things have been put up in the exhibition in detail. And see the coincidence! I was born in Vadnagar and I am the MP from Kashi, and Sarnath is also situated there. Friends,\\nThe Global Buddhist Summit is being hosted at a time when India has completed 75 years of its independence and is celebrating the ‘Amrit Mahotsav’ of its independence. India also has huge goals for its future as well as new resolutions for global welfare in this ‘Amrit Kaal’. Today, India has taken new initiatives on several issues in the world. And our biggest inspiration behind those initiatives is Lord Buddha. Friends,\\nYou are all familiar that the path of Buddha is ‘Pariyatti’, ‘Patipatti’ and ‘Pativedha’. That is, Theory, Practice and Realization. India is moving fast on all these three points in the last nine years. We have continuously propagated the values of Lord Buddha. We have worked with a sense of dedication to take the teachings of Buddha to the masses. ‘Patipatti’ is at the forefront whether it is the development of Buddha Circuit in India and Nepal, efforts to rejuvenate pilgrimage centres like Sarnath and Kushinagar, the construction of the Kushinagar International Airport, the India International Centre for Buddhist Culture and Heritage in Lumbini with the cooperation of India and IBC. It is the legacy of Lord Buddha's teachings that India considers the grief of every human being as its own. Be it peace missions in different countries of the world, or calamity like the earthquake in Turkey, India stands with humanity in times of every crisis by exerting its full potential. Today the world is watching, understanding and accepting this sentiment of India's 140 crore people. And I believe that this forum of the International Buddhist Confederation is giving a new extension to this feeling. It will give new opportunities to all like-minded and like-hearted countries to spread Buddhism and peace as a family. The discussion on how we handle the current challenges is not only relevant, but also holds a ray of hope for the world. We have to remember that the journey from problems to solutions is the actual journey of Buddha. Buddha did not leave the palace because he had any problems. Buddha left the palace, gave up the royal luxury, because he felt that he had all the comforts available to him whereas there was misery in the lives of others. If we want to make the world happy, this Buddha mantra of totality is the only way to go beyond the idea of self and narrow mindedness. We have to think about the poverty-stricken people around us. We have to think about the countries dealing with a scarcity of resources. This is the only way to establish a better and stable world, it is necessary. Today, it is the need of the hour that the priority of every individual and every nation should be the interest of the world, the 'Global World Interest', along with the interest of the country. Friends,\\nIt is universally accepted that the current time is the most challenging time of this century. Today, on the one hand, two countries are at war for months, while on the other hand, the world is also going through economic instability. Threats like terrorism and religious fanaticism are attacking the soul of humanity. Climate change is looming large over the existence of the entire humanity. Glaciers are melting, ecology is being destroyed and species are becoming extinct. But in the midst of all this, there are millions of people like us who have faith in Buddha, who believe in the welfare of all living beings. This hope, this faith is the biggest strength of this earth. When this hope gets united, the Buddha's Dhamma will become the world's belief and Buddha's realization will become the belief of humanity. Friends,\\nThere is no problem in the modern world whose solution we could not find in the teachings of the Buddha hundreds of years ago. The war and unrest that the world is suffering today, the Buddha had given solutions centuries ago. Buddha said: जयन् वेरन् पसवति, दुक्खन् सेति पराजितो, उपसंतो सुखन् सेति, हित्व जय पराजयः i.e., Conquest begets enmity; the conquered lie down in distress. The unconscious person lies down in happiness, dismissing victory and defeat alike. Therefore, we can be happy only by discarding defeats, wins, fights and quarrels. Lord Buddha has also told the way to overcome the war. Lord Buddha has said: नहि वेरेन् वेरानी, सम्मन तीध उदाचन्, अवेरेन च सम्मन्ति, एस धम्मो सन्नतनो। i.e. enmity does not calm down enmity. Enmity is pacified by affinity. Lord Buddha's words are:\\xa0 सुखा संघस्स सामग्गी, समग्गानं तपो सुखो। i.e. happiness lies in the unity between the unions. There is happiness in living together with all people. Friends,\\nToday we find that imposing one's thoughts, one's faith on others is becoming a big crisis for the world. But, what did Lord Buddha say? Lord Buddha said: अत्तान मेव पठमन्, पति रूपे निवेसये i.e. one should practice good behaviour before preaching to others. In the modern era, we see that whether it is Gandhiji or many other leaders of the world, they got inspiration from this spirit. But we have to remember, Buddha didn't just stop there. He went a step ahead and said: \\xa0अप्\\u200dप दीपो भव: i.e. be your own light. Today the answer to many questions lies in this sermon of Lord Buddha. Therefore, a few years ago, I proudly said in the United Nations that India has given the world Buddh, not Yudh (war). Where there is Buddha's compassion, there is coordination and not conflict; there is peace and not discord. Friends,\\nThe path of Buddha is the path of the future, the path of sustainability. Had the world followed the teachings of Buddha, we would not even have faced a crisis like climate change. This crisis developed because some nations stopped caring about others, about the future generations in the last century. For decades, they were of the view that the effect of this tampering with nature would not affect them. Those countries blamed it on others only. But Lord Buddha has clearly said in the Dhammapada that as a water pot is filled with drop by drop, so the repeated mistakes become the cause of destruction. After alerting humanity in this way, Buddha also said that if we correct mistakes and do good deeds continuously, then solutions to problems are also found. माव-मईंएथ पुण्\\u200dयीअस्, न मन् तन् आग-मिस्सति, उद-बिन्दु-निपातेन, उद-कुम्भोपि पूरति, धीरो पूरति पुण्\\u200dयीअस्, थोकं थोकम्पि आचिनन्। i.e. do not ignore the good deeds thinking that the fruit of any work will not come to me. The pot gets filled drop by drop of water. Similarly, a wise man, accumulating little by little, fills himself with virtue. Friends,\\nEvery person is affecting the earth in one way or the other. Be it our lifestyle, our dresses, eating or travelling habits, everything has an impact, it makes a difference. Everyone can also fight the challenges of climate change. If people become aware and change their lifestyle, then even this big problem can be dealt with and this is the way of Buddha. With this spirit, India has started Mission LiFE. Mission LiFE means Lifestyle for the Environment! This mission is also influenced by the inspirations of Buddha, furthering the thoughts of Buddha. Friends,\\nToday, it is very necessary that the world should come out of the definitions of materialism and selfishness and imbibe this feeling of ‘भवतु सब्ब मंगलन्’ (May all be well). Buddha should not only be made a symbol, but also a reflection, only then the resolution of ‘भवतु सब्ब मंगलन्’ will be fulfilled. Therefore, we have to remember the words of the Buddha: \\xa0“मा निवत्त, अभि-क्कम”! i.e.\"),\n",

Many congratulations to all my brothers and sisters of Kerala and Thrissur on the occasion of Thrissur Pooram festival. Thrissur is known as the cultural capital of Kerala. Where there is culture, there are traditions, there are also arts. There is spirituality as well as philosophy. There are festivals as well as there is gaiety. I am glad that Thrissur is keeping this heritage and identity alive. Sree Seetha Rama Swamy Temple has been working as a dynamic centre in this direction over the years. I am told that this temple has been made more divine and grand now. The gold-encrusted sanctum is also being dedicated to Lord Sree Seetha Rama, Lord Ayyappa and Lord Shiva on the occasion. And friends,\\nIt is impossible not to have Sri Hanuman where there is Sree Seetha Rama. Hence, the grand statue of Hanuman ji, which is 55 feet high, will shower his blessings on the devotees. On this occasion, I extend my wishes for Kumbhabhishekam to all the devotees. In particular, I would like to congratulate Shri TS Kalyanaraman ji and all the members of the Kalyan family. I remember when you came to meet me in Gujarat many years ago, you told me in detail about the effect and light of this temple. Today, with the blessings of Lord Sree Seetha Ramaji, I am being a part of this auspicious occasion. With mind, heart and consciousness, I am feeling that I am right there in the temple among you and I am feeling spiritual bliss as well. Friends,\\nThrissur and Sree Seetha Rama Swamy Temple are not only the pinnacle of faith, they are also the reflection of the consciousness and soul of India. When foreign invaders were destroying our temples and symbols in medieval times, they thought that they would destroy India's identity through terror. But they were oblivious that though India is visible in the symbols, it lives in its knowledge and thought. India lives in its quest for the eternal. This is the reason why India has been alive even after facing every challenge. That's why India’s soul has been proclaiming its immortality in the form of Sree Seetha Rama Swamy and Bhagwan Ayyappa. These temples from those times declare that the idea of 'Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat' is an immortal idea of thousands of years. Today, we are taking this idea forward by taking a pledge to be proud of our heritage in the ‘Amrit Kaal’ of independence. Friends,\\nOur temples and pilgrimages have been symbols of the values and prosperity of our society for centuries. I am glad that Sree Seetha Rama Swamy Temple is preserving the grandeur and splendour of ancient India. You are also taking forward the tradition of temples where there was a system of returning the resources received from the society as service. I am told that many public welfare programs are run through this temple. I would like the temple to add more resolutions of the country to these efforts. Be it Shree Anna Abhiyan, Swachhta Abhiyan or public awareness towards natural farming, you can give more momentum to these efforts. I am sure the blessings of Sree Seetha Rama Swamy ji will be showered upon everyone and we will continue to work for the resolutions of the country. Once again many congratulations to all of you on this auspicious occasion. Thanks a lot. DISCLAIMER: This is the approximate translation of PM’s speech.

Mishra ji, Shri Rajiv Gauba ji, Shri Srinivasan ji and all the Karmayogi friends attending this program and ladies and gentlemen! Best wishes to all of you on the Civil Services Day. This year's Civil Services Day is very important. This is a period when the country has completed 75 years of its independence. This is a period when the country has started taking rapid steps to achieve the mammoth goals of the next 25 years. The officers, who joined this service 15-20-25 years ago, had a big role in bringing the country to this ‘Amrit Kaal’ of independence. Now, there is an important role for the young officers who are going to be in this service for the next 15-20-25 years. Therefore, I would tell every civil service officer in India today that you are very lucky. I am sure that you will have complete faith in my words. Maybe, some people don't even believe that they are not blessed. Congratulations to everyone for their own notions. You have got an opportunity to serve the country during this period. It is the responsibility of all of us to fulfil the dreams of the freedom fighters of the country in the ‘Amrit Kaal’ of independence. We have little time, but plenty of potential. Our goals are tough, but our spirits are not low. We may have to climb a mountain, but our intentions are higher than the sky. India, which has reached today in the last nine years, has prepared our country for a very big leap. I often say that the bureaucracy in the country is the same, the officers and employees are the same, but the results have changed. If India has assumed a special role on the global arena in the last nine years, then the cooperation of all of you has been very important in this regard. If even the poorest of the poor of the country has got the confidence of good governance in the last nine years, then your hard work has paid off in this, too. If India's development has gained new momentum in the last nine years, it was also not possible without your participation. Despite the catastrophe of Corona, today India is the fifth largest economy in the world. Today India dominates the Fintech world and it is number one in terms of digital payments. Today India is among those countries in the world where mobile data is the cheapest. Today India has the third largest start-up ecosystem in the world. Today, the rural economy of the country is going through a massive change. Compared to 2014, the electrification of railway lines is taking place in the country 10 times faster. As compared to 2014, National Highways are being constructed in the country at double the speed today. As compared to 2014, the capacity augmentation in the country's ports has almost doubled. Compared to 2014, the number of airports in the country has more than doubled today. The awards given here today prove your participation in the success of the country and reflect your sense of service. I once again congratulate all the award winning colleagues. Friends,\\nDuring my address from the Red Fort on August 15 last year, I called for ‘Panch Prans’ (five pledges). These are -- to have a grand goal of building a developed India, to get rid of every mentality of slavery, to have a sense of pride in India's heritage, to continuously strengthen the unity and solidarity of the country, and to keep one's duties paramount. The energy that will emanate from the inspiration of these ‘Panch Prans’ will take our country to the height it has always deserved. I am also happy to note that you have also kept the theme of Civil Services Day as 'Developed India' this year. What is the thinking behind the creation of a developed India is also reflected in the book which has just been released. Developed India is not just limited to modern infrastructure or modern construction. It is necessary for a developed India that India's government system should support the aspirations of every countryman. It is necessary for a developed India that every government employee of India should help the countrymen in making their dreams come true. It is essential for a developed India that the negativity which was associated with the system in India in the past few decades should be changed into positivity and our system should fulfil its role as a partner to the countrymen. Friends,\\nOur decades-old experience after independence has been that no matter how well the plans are, how wonderful the roadmap is on paper, but if the last mile delivery is not improved, the expected results will not be achieved. You are well aware that it was due to the earlier system that there were more than four crore fake gas connections in the country. It was due to the earlier system that there were more than four crore fake ration cards in the country. It was due to the earlier system that one crore imaginary women and children in the country were being helped by the Ministry of Women and Child Development. It was due to the earlier system that the Minority Affairs Ministry was doling out scholarships to about 30 lakh fake youths. And this is also the result of the earlier system itself that lakhs of fake bank accounts were created in the country under MNREGA and money was transferred to lakhs of workers who did not exist. You imagine, who were never born, who were born only on paper, a huge ecosystem was involved in corruption under the guise of millions and crores of fake names. Today, with the efforts of the country and all of you, this system has changed and about three lakh crore rupees of the country have been saved from going into the wrong hands. All of you deserve congratulations for this feat. Today this money is being used for the welfare of the poor, making their lives easier. Friends,\\nWhen time is limited, it becomes very important to decide what will be our direction and what will be our working style. Today the challenge is not how efficient you are, but the challenge is to determine how to remove the deficiency. If our direction is correct, then the strength of efficiency will increase and we will move forward. But if there is deficiency then we will not get the desired results. You recall earlier new methods were invented to control even the smallest thing in every sector under the guise of deficiency. But today the same deficiency has been converted into efficiency. Today, the same efficiency is identifying the smallest obstacles related to the policy, so that they can be removed. Earlier, the approach was that 'the government will do everything', but now there is thinking that 'the government will work for everybody'. Now the government is using time and resources efficiently with the spirit of working 'for all'. The motto of today's government is -- Nation First-Citizen First. The priority of today's government is preference for the underprivileged. Today, the governance is available up to the Aspirational District and Aspirational Blocks. Today's government does not consider the country's border villages as the last villages, but as the first villages and is running the Vibrant Village scheme. This has been an important highlight of our government in the past few years. But we always have to keep one more thing in mind. We have to work even harder and constantly need innovative solutions for 100% saturation. Now that such a vast infrastructure of Digital India is available with us, we have such a huge amount of data, but still we see that every department asks for the same information, the same documents, which are already there in some or the other database. A lot of administrative time is consumed into giving NoC, certificates and clearances etc. We need to find their solutions. Only then Ease of Living will increase, only then Ease of Doing Business will improve. I would also like to give you the example of the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan. Under it, data layers related to all types of infrastructure are available on a single platform. We have to make maximum use of it. We should also make maximum use of the PM GatiShakti for better planning and execution in the social sector. This will help us identify the needs of the people and remove the difficulties in execution. This will further simplify communication between departments and between districts and blocks. This will also make it easier for us to make further strategies. Friends,\\nThis ‘Amrit Kaal’ of independence has brought as many opportunities for all the government employees of India, but it is equally challenging. In spite of so many achievements, in spite of rapid progress, why am I calling it a challenge? I think you must also understand this. Today, the aspirations of the people of India are increasing very fast. The countrymen do not want to wait any longer for a developed India and for the system to change. In order to fulfil this aspiration of the people of the country, all of us will have to mobilize with all our might. Decisions will have to be taken fast and those decisions will have to be implemented as fast as possible. And you have to keep this in mind that it is not because I am saying this. You must also be realizing that the expectations of the whole world from India have increased a lot. Experts from all over the world and various international organizations are saying that India's time has arrived. In such a situation, India's bureaucracy does not have to lose a single moment. Today, I would like to make a request to the bureaucracy of India, to every government employee of India, be it in the state government or the central government. The country has put a lot of trust in you and has given you an opportunity. Therefore, live up to that trust and work. I often tell you that in your service, the basis of your decisions should be only the interest of the nation. It is possible that you will come across a situation when you have to make a decision for an individual or for a group, but even then you must think about how your decision, even if it is a small one, will be in the interest of the nation. In other words, the criterion for you is the interest of the nation. And today I want to add one more thing to this criterion for India's bureaucracy. I am sure you will live up to this criterion also. Friends,\\nPolitical parties are very important in any democracy and it is also necessary. And this is the beauty of democracy. Every party has its own ideology and the Constitution has given this right to every party. But being a bureaucrat, being a government employee, now you must take care of some questions in your every decision. Is the political party, which has come to power, using taxpayers’ money for itself, or for the benefit of the country? Friends, you will have to keep an eye on it. Is that political party using government money for its expansion or for the development of the country? Is that political party looting government money to create its own vote bank or is it working to make everyone's life easier? Is that political party promoting itself with government money, or is it honestly creating awareness among people? Is that political party appointing its own workers in various organizations or is it giving everyone an equal opportunity to get jobs in a transparent manner? Is that political party not making changes in policies so that new avenues of black money can be created for its masters? You must consider all these questions before making every decision. The bureaucracy which Sardar Patel used to call the steel frame of India, the same bureaucracy has to live up to his expectations as well. Because now if there is any lapse on the part of the bureaucracy, then the country's wealth will be looted, tax payers' money will be destroyed and the dreams of the country's youth will be shattered. Friends,\\nI would like to specially say a few things to the youth who have joined the civil service of the country in the last few years or in the last decade. You also know that there are two ways to live life. The first is 'getting things done' and the second is 'letting things happen'. The first is a reflection of an active attitude and the second is a passive attitude. The person who prefers the first way thinks that yes, change can come. A person who believes in the second method says, 'Okay, let it be, everything goes on like this, it has been going on before, it will continue like this, it will happen on its own, it will be fine'. Those who believe in 'getting things done' go ahead and take responsibility. When they get the opportunity to work in a team, they become the driving force. With such a burning desire to make a difference in people's lives, you will leave a legacy that will be remembered by many. You also have to remember that your success as an officer will not be measured by what you have achieved for yourself. Your success will be measured by how your work has changed the lives of others. What do the people whose lives you were responsible for changing think of you? Therefore, you always have to remember that ‘good governance is the key’. When there is people centric governance, when there is development oriented governance, it not only solves the problems, but also gives better results. There is accountability towards the public in good governance. If one district performs well in the same state and the other does not, then the real reason behind this is the difference in good governance. We have the example of Aspirational Districts in front of us. When we appointed young officers of the country full of enthusiasm there and inspired them for good governance, the results were also excellent. Today, many Aspirational Districts are performing very well in terms of development parameters as compared to other districts of the country. When you focus on people's participation, then the sense of ownership among the public will also be stronger. And when the people take ownership of a scheme, unprecedented results are sure to come. You have the examples in the form of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Amrit Sarovar Abhiyan, Jal Jeevan Mission etc. The main basis of their success is the ownership by the public. Friends,\\nI am told that you are preparing a District Vision@100 keeping in mind the aspirations of your district. The same vision should be up to the panchayat level. Which sectors do we have to focus on in our Gram Panchayat, our block, our district, our state? What are the changes to be made to attract investments? What are the products in our district, block or panchayat which can be exported? We should have a clear vision regarding these. You can link MSMEs and Self Help Groups to promote local products in your area. I think it is the need of the hour for all of you to encourage local talent, support local entrepreneurship and promote the start-up culture. Friends,\\nIt has been more than 20 years for me being the Head of the Government. Many of you have been working with me over the years. I would say that I am fortunate that I have got the opportunity to work with colleagues like you. You know how much emphasis I have always laid on capacity building. I am happy that today 'Mission Karmayogi' has become a huge campaign among all the civil servants. The aim of ‘Mission Karmayogi’ is to utilize the full potential of civil servants. The Capacity Building Commission is taking this campaign forward with full force. I also believe that training and learning should not remain a formality for a few months. Therefore, the iGOT platform has been created to ensure that quality material related to training and learning is available everywhere at all times. Now all the new recruits are also being trained with the orientation module of 'Karmayogi Prarambh' on iGot. Friends,\\nOver the years, the government has freed the bureaucracy from yet another shackle. This is the bond of protocol and hierarchy. I myself have started breaking the shackles of hierarchy. I constantly meet with secretaries and assistant secretaries. I also meet with the trainee officers. We have also promoted brainstorming camps in the central government for new ideas and to increase everyone's participation within the department. Another big change has come due to our endeavours. Earlier, the officers used to get the experience of working in the Central Government on deputation only after spending considerable time in the states. No one thought that if these officers did not have experience of working in the Central Government, then how would they implement the programs of the Centre? We tried to fill this gap through the assistant secretary program. Now, the young IAS gets a chance to work in the Central Government and gain experience in the initial year of his career. He gets to learn something from senior most people. We have to take forward such innovations and make constant efforts to take these efforts to the pinnacle of results. Friends,\\nThe country has considered the ‘Amrit Yatra’ of 25 years as a period of duty for a developed India. The centenary of independence, the golden century of the country, will be when we will give first priority to our duties. Duty is not an option for us but a resolution. This is the time of rapid change. Your role will also be determined not by your rights, but by your duties and your performance. The power of the citizens of the country has increased in New India and so is the power of India. You have got an opportunity to play an important role in this new emerging India. When history will make an assessment after 100 years of independence, you have the opportunity that your name should figure prominently in it. You can say with pride that you have played a role in creating new systems for the country and improving the systems. I am sure all of you will continue to expand your role in nation building. Capacity building should be our endeavour at every moment, for ourselves, for our colleagues and also for the system. We will have to keep on making efforts to surpass new heights. I believe that the Civil Services Day is not an annual ritual. This Civil Services Day is the time for resolutions. This Civil Services Day is the time for new decisions. This is the occasion to implement the decisions in the stipulated time with enthusiasm and energy. If we move forward with a new energy, new inspiration, new power, new strength, new resolve from this occasion, then we will certainly achieve what we want. With this belief, I wish you a lot.\"),\n",

अगर हमारी दिशा सही होगी, तो efficiency की strength बढ़ेगी और हम आगे बढ़ेंगे। लेकिन अगर deficiency होगी तो हमें वो परिणाम नहीं मिलेंगे, जिसके लिए हम प्रयास कर रहे थे। आप याद करिए, पहले deficiency की आड़ में हर सेक्टर की छोटी से छोटी चीज को control करने के तरीके बनाए जाते थे। लेकिन आज वही deficiency, efficiency में बदली है। आज वही, efficiency पॉलिसी से जुड़ी छोटी से छोटी बाधाओं की पहचान कर रही है, ताकि उन्हें हटाया जा सके। पहले ये सोच थी कि ‘सरकार सब कुछ करेगी’, लेकिन अब सोच है कि ‘सरकार सबके लिए करेगी’।\\nअब सरकार ‘सबके लिए’ काम करने की भावना के साथ time और resources का efficiently उपयोग कर रही है। आज की सरकार का ध्येय है- Nation First-Citizen First आज की सरकार की प्राथमिकता है- वंचितों को वरीयता। आज की सरकार, Aspirational District तक जा रही है, Aspirational Blocks तक जा रही है। आज की सरकार, देश के सीमावर्ती गांवों को, आखिरी गांव ना मानकर, उन्हें First Village मानते हुए काम कर रही है, वाइब्रेंट विलेज योजना चला रही है। ये बीते वर्षों में हमारी सरकार की बहुत बड़ी पहचान रही है। लेकिन हमें एक और बात हमेशा ध्यान रखनी है। 100 परसेंट सैचुरेशन के लिए हमें इससे भी अधिक मेहनत की, इनोवेटिव समाधानों की पल-पल ज़रूरत पड़ेगी। अब जैसे डिजिटल इंडिया का इतना व्यापक इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर हमारे पास उपलब्ध है, इतना बड़ा डेटा सेट हमारे पास है। लेकिन अभी भी हम देखते हैं कि हर विभाग अपने-अपने हिसाब से वही जानकारी, वही दस्तावेज़ मांगता है, जो पहले से ही किसी ना किसी डेटाबेस में मौजूद है।\\nप्रशासन का बहुत बड़ा समय NoC, प्रमाण पत्र, क्लीयरेंस, इन्हीं सब कामों में चला जाता है। हमें इनके Solutions निकालने ही होंगे। तभी Ease of Living बढ़ेगी, तभी Ease of Doing Business बढ़ेगा। मैं आपको पीएम गतिशक्ति नेशनल मास्टर प्लान का भी उदाहरण देना चाहता हूँ। इसके तहत हर प्रकार के इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर से जुड़े डेटा लेयर्स एक ही प्लेटफॉर्म पर उपलब्ध हैं। इसका हमें अधिक से अधिक उपयोग करना है। हमें सोशल सेक्टर में बेहतर planning और execution के लिए भी पीएम गतिशक्ति का ज्यादा से ज्यादा इस्तेमाल करना चाहिए। इससे हमें लोगों की जरूरतों को Identify करने में और execution में आने वाली मुश्किलों को दूर करने में मदद मिलेगी ही मिलेगी। इससे डिपार्टमेंट्स के बीच, डिस्ट्रिक्ट और ब्लॉक के बीच संवाद और सरल होगा। इससे हमारे लिए आगे की स्ट्रेटजी बनाना भी ज्यादा आसान होगा।\\nसाथियों,\\nआजादी का ये अमृतकाल, ये Time Period, भारत के सभी सरकारी कर्मचारियों के लिए जितने बड़े अवसर लेकर आया है, उतना ही चुनौतीपूर्ण भी है। इतनी सारी उपलब्धियों के बावजूद, तेज गति से हासिल हुई सफलताओं के बावजूद, मैं इसे चुनौती क्यों कह रहा हूं, और मैं मानता हूँ कि इस बात को आपको भी समझना होगा। आज भारत के लोगों की Aspirations, उनकी आकांक्षाएं बहुत तेजी से बढ़ रही हैं। विकसित भारत के लिए, व्यवस्थाओं में बदलाव के लिए अब देशवासी और ज्यादा इंतजार नहीं करना चाहते। देश के लोगों की इस Aspiration को पूरा करने के लिए हम सबको, आपको पूरे सामर्थ्य से जुटना ही होगा, तेजी से निर्णय लेने होंगे, उन निर्णयों को उतनी ही तेजी से लागू करना होगा। और आपको एक और बात का ध्यान वश्\\u200dय रखना होगा कि आज, और यह मैं कह रहा हूं इसलिए नहीं आप भी अनुभव करते होंगे, आज पूरे विश्व की भी भारत से अपेक्षाएं बहुत ज्यादा बढ़ी हुई हैं।\\nदुनिया भर के एक्सपर्ट, विभिन्न अंतरराष्ट्रीय संस्थाएं ये कह रही हैं कि भारत का समय आ गया है- India's time has arrived. ऐसी स्थिति में भारत की ब्यूरोक्रेसी को एक भी पल गंवाना नहीं है। आज मैं भारत की ब्यूरोक्रेसी से, भारत के हर सरकारी कर्मचारी से, चाहे वो राज्य सरकार में हो या केंद्र सरकार में, मैं एक आग्रह जरूर करना चाहता हूं। देश ने आप पर बहुत भरोसा किया है, आपको मौका दिया है, उस भरोसे को कायम रखते हुए काम करिए। मैं आपसे अक्सर कहता हूं कि आपकी सर्विस में, आपके निर्णयों का आधार सिर्फ और सिर्फ देशहित होना चाहिए। हो सकता है फील्ड में आपको किसी एक व्यक्ति के लिए कोई फैसला लेना हो, किसी एक समूह के लिए कोई फैसला लेना हो, लेकिन तब भी आप ये जरूर सोचें कि मेरे इस निर्णय से, निर्णय भले ही छोटा क्\\u200dयों न हो, मेरे से इस निर्णय से देश का क्या भला होगा? यानि आपके लिए कसौटी, देशहित ही है। और मैं आज भारत की ब्यूरोक्रेसी के लिए इस कसौटी में एक और बात जोड़ना चाहता हूं। मुझे विश्वास है, आप इस कसौटी पर भी खरा उतरेंगे।\\nसाथियों,\\nकिसी भी लोकतंत्र में राजनीतिक दलों का बहुत महत्व होता ही है और ये आवश्यक भी है। और ये लोकतंत्र की ब्यूटी है। हर दल की अपनी विचारधारा होती है, संविधान ने हर दल को ये अधिकार दिया\\xa0 है। लेकिन एक ब्यूरोक्रेट के तौर पर, एक सरकारी कर्मचारी के तौर पर अब आपको अपने हर निर्णय में कुछ सवालों का अवश्य ध्यान रखना ही पड़ेगा। जो राजनीतिक दल सत्ता में आया है, वो Taxpayers Money का इस्तेमाल अपने दल के हित के लिए कर रहा है, या देश के हित के लिए उसका उपयोग कहां हो रहा है? यह आप लोगों को देखना ही होगा दोस्\\u200dतों। वो राजनीतिक दल, अपने दल के विस्तार में सरकारी धन का उपयोग कर रहा है या फिर देश के विकास में उस पैसे का इस्तेमाल कर रहा है? वो राजनीतिक दल, अपना वोटबैंक बनाने के लिए सरकारी धन लुटा रहा है या फिर सभी का जीवन आसान बनाने के लिए काम कर रहा है? वो राजनीतिक दल, सरकारी पैसे से अपना प्रचार कर रहा है, या फिर ईमानदारी से लोगों को जागरूक कर रहा है? वो राजनीतिक दल, अपने कार्यकर्ताओं को ही विभिन्न संस्थाओं में नियुक्त कर रहा है या फिर सबको पारदर्शी रूप से नौकरी में आने का अवसर दे रहा है? वो राजनीतिक दल, नीतियों में इसलिए तो फेरबदल नहीं कर रहा, ताकि उसके आकाओं की काली कमाई के नए रास्ते बनें? आप अपने हर फैसले से पहले इन सवालों के बारे में भी जरूर सोचें। सरदार पटेल जिस ब्यूरोक्रेसी को स्टील फ्रेम ऑफ इंडिया कहा करते थे, उसी ब्यूरोक्रेसी को उनकी अपेक्षाओं पर भी खरा उतरना है। क्योंकि अब अगर ब्यूरोक्रेसी से चूक हुई, तो देश का धन लुट जाएगा, Taxpayers Money तबाह हो जाएगा, देश के युवाओं के सपने चकनाचूर हो जाएंगे।\\nसाथियों,\\nजो युवा, बीते कुछ वर्षों में, या पिछले दशक में देश की सिविल सेवा से जुड़े हैं, उन्हें मैं, कुछ बातें विशेष तौर पर कहना चाहता हूं। आप भी जानते हैं कि जीवन जीने के दो तरीके होते हैं। पहला है ‘getting things done’. दूसरा है ‘letting things happen’ पहला active attitude और दूसरा passive attitude का प्रतिबिंब है। पहले तरीके से जीने वाले व्यक्ति की सोच होती है कि हां, बदलाव आ सकता है। दूसरे तरीके में विश्वास करने वाला व्यक्ति कहता है, ठीक है, रहने दो, सब ऐसे ही चलता है, पहले से भी चलता आया है, आगे भी चलता रहेगा, वो तो अपने आप हो जाएगा, ठीक हो जाएगा’। ‘Getting things done’ में यकीन रखने वाले आगे बढ़कर जिम्मेदारी लेते हैं। जब उन्हें टीम में काम करने का अवसर मिलता है तो वो हर काम का driving force बन जाते हैं। लोगों के जीवन में बदलाव लाने की ऐसी ज्वलंत इच्छा से ही आप एक ऐसी विरासत छोड़ जाएंगे, जिसे लोग याद करेंगे। आपको ये भी याद रखना होगा कि एक अफसर के रूप में आपकी सफलता इस बात से नहीं आंकी जाएगी कि आपने अपने लिए क्या हासिल किया। आपकी सफलता का आकलन इस बात से होगा कि आपके काम से, आपके करियर से दूसरों का जीवन कितना बदला है। जिनका जीवन बदलने की जिम्मेदारी आपके पास थी, वे लोग आपके बारे में क्या सोचते हैं? इसलिए आपको ये हमेशा याद रखना है- Good Governance is the key. जब People Centric Governance होती है, जब Development Oriented Governance होती है, तो वो समस्याओं का समाधान भी करती है और बेहतर Result भी देती है। Good Governance में जनता के प्रति जवाबदेही होती है। एक ही राज्य में एक जिला अच्छा perform करे और दूसरा ना करें तो इसके पीछे असली वजह Good Governance का अंतर ही होता है। हमारे सामने Aspirational Districts का उदाहरण है। हमने जब जोश से भरे देश के युवा अफसरों को वहां नियुक्त किया, उन्हें Good Governance के लिए प्रेरित किया, तो नतीजे भी बेहतरीन आए। आज अनेक Aspirational Districts, Development Parameters में देश के दूसरे जिलों से भी बहुत अच्छा प्रदर्शन कर रहे हैं। जब आप इस पर फोकस करेंगे, People’s Participation पर फोकस करेंगे, तो जनता में भी Ownership का भाव, उसकी भावना और अधिक मजबूत होगी। और जब जनता जनार्दन किसी योजना की Ownership ले लेती है, तो अभूतपूर्व नतीजे आना सुनिश्चित हो जाता है। आप स्वच्छ भारत अभियान देख लीजिए, अमृत सरोवर अभियान देख लीजिए, जल जीवन मिशन देख लीजिए, इनकी सफलता का बड़ा आधार, जनता द्वारा ली गई Ownership है।\\nसाथियों,\\nमुझे बताया गया है कि आप अपने जिले की आकांक्षाओं को ध्यान में रखते हुए एक डिस्ट्रिक्ट विजन@100 तैयार कर रहे हैं। ऐसा ही विजन पंचायत स्तर तक होना चाहिए। अपनी ग्राम पंचायत, अपने ब्लॉक, अपने डिस्ट्रिक्ट, अपने राज्य में हमें किन सेक्टर्स पर फोकस करना है? इन्वेस्टमेंट्स को आकर्षित करने के लिए कौन-कौन से बदलाव करने हैं? हमारे जिले, ब्लॉक या पंचायत में कौन से प्रोडक्ट्स हैं, जिन्हें हम एक्सपोर्ट कर सकते हैं या उस स्तर तक ले जा सकते हैं? इनको लेकर एक स्पष्ट विजन हमारे पास होना चाहिए। आप अपने क्षेत्र में स्थानीय उत्पादों को बढ़ावा देने के लिए MSME और स्वयं सहायता समूहों के बीच कड़ियों को जोड़ सकते हैं। आप सभी के लिए, लोकल टैलेंट को प्रोत्साहित करना, लोकल आंट्रप्रन्योरशिप को सपोर्ट करना, स्टार्ट अप कल्चर को बढ़ावा देना मैं समझता हूँ कि ये समय की मांग है।\\nसाथियों,\\nHead of the Government रहते हुए मुझे 20 साल से भी ज्यादा समय हो चुका है। आप में से कई लोग बरसों से मेरे साथ काम कर रहे हैं। और मैं तो कहूंगा कि मेरा सौभाग्\\u200dय है कि आप जैसे साथियों के साथ मुझे काम करने का अवसर मिला है। आप जानते हैं कि मैंने हमेशा capacity building पर कितना ज़ोर दिया है। मुझे खुशी है कि आज आप सब civil servants के बीच ‘मिशन कर्मयोगी’ एक बड़ा अभियान बन चुका है। मिशन कर्मयोगी का मकसद है- civil servants के full potential का उपयोग करना। Capacity Building Commission इस अभियान को पूरी मजबूती से आगे बढ़ा रहा है। मेरा ये भी मानना है कि ट्रेनिंग और लर्निंग कुछ महीनों की औपचारिकता बनकर नहीं रहनी चाहिए। इसलिए, ट्रेनिंग और लर्निंग से जुड़ा quality material हर जगह हर समय उपलब्ध हो, इसके लिए iGOT प्लैटफ़ार्म बनाया गया है। अब सभी नए recruits को iGot पर ‘कर्मयोगी प्रारम्भ’ के orientation module के साथ भी ट्रेन किया जा रहा है।\\nसाथियों,\\nबीते वर्षों में, सरकार ने ब्यूरोक्रेसी को एक और बंधन से मुक्ति दिलाई है। ये बंधन है- प्रोटोकॉल और hierarchy का बंधन। आप जानते हैं कि hierarchy के बंधनों को तोड़ने की शुरुआत भी मैंने खुद की है। मैं लगातार सेक्रेटरीज़ से लेकर असिस्टेंट सेक्रेटरीज़ तक से मिलता हूँ। मैं ट्रेनी ऑफिसर्स के साथ मुलाक़ात करता हूँ। हमने डिपार्टमेंट के भीतर हर किसी की भागीदारी बढ़ाने के लिए, नए ideas के लिए केंद्र सरकार में भी चिंतन शिविर को बढ़ावा दिया है। हमारे प्रयासों से एक और बड़ा बदलाव आया है। पहले वर्षों तक राज्यों में रहने के बाद ही अधिकारियों को deputation पर केंद्र सरकार में काम करने का अनुभव मिलता था। ये किसी ने नहीं सोचा कि अगर इन अधिकारियों के पास केंद्र सरकार में काम का अनुभव ही नहीं होगा तो वो केंद्र के प्रोग्राम्स को जमीन पर लागू कैसे करेंगे? हमने assistant सेक्रेटरी प्रोग्राम के जरिए इस गैप को भी भरने का प्रयास किया। अब युवा IAS को अपने career की शुरुआत में ही केंद्र सरकार में काम करने का, उसके अनुभव लेने का मौका मिलता है। Senior most लोगों के साथ उसको कुछ सीखने का मौका मिलता है। हमें इस तरह के इनोवेशन्स को आगे बढ़ाना है, इन प्रयासों को परिणामों के शिखर पर ले जाने की निरंतर कोशिश करनी है।\\nसाथियों,\\nविकसित भारत के लिए 25 वर्षों की अमृत यात्रा को देश ने कर्तव्यकाल माना है। आज़ादी की शताब्दी देश की स्वर्ण शताब्दी तब होगी, जब हम कर्तव्यों को पहली प्राथमिकता देंगे। कर्तव्य हमारे लिए विकल्प नहीं संकल्प हैं। ये समय तेजी से बदलाव का समय है। आपकी भूमिका भी आपके अधिकारों से नहीं, आपके कर्तव्यों और उनके पालन से तय होगी। नए भारत में देश के नागरिक की ताकत बढ़ी है, भारत की भी ताकत बढ़ी है। इस नए उभरते भारत में आपको अहम भूमिका निभाने का अवसर मिला है। आज़ादी के सौ साल बाद जब इतिहास आकलन करेगा, तो आपके पास अवसर है कि उसमें एक प्रमुख नाम आपका भी हो। आप गर्व से ये कहें कि मैंने देश के लिए नई व्यवस्थाओं के सृजन में भूमिका निभाई है, व्यवस्थाओं को सुधारने में बड़ी भूमिका निभाई है। मुझे विश्वास है कि आप सभी राष्ट्रनिर्माण में अपनी भूमिका को विस्तार देते रहेंगे। Capacity building हर पल हमारी कोशिश रहनी चाहिए खुद के लिए भी, साथियों के लिए भी और व्\\u200dयवस्\\u200dथा के लिए भी हमें उत्\\u200dतरोत्\\u200dतर नई ऊंचाईयों को पार करने की स्थितियों को पर्याप्\\u200dत करते ही रहना होगा। मुझे विश्\\u200dवास है कि civil services day यह वार्षिक ritual नहीं है। ये civil services day संकल्\\u200dपों का समय है। ये civil services day नये निर्णयों का समय है। निर्णयों को निर्धारित समय में कार्यान्वित करने का उत्\\u200dसाह और ऊर्जा से भरने का अवसर है। इस अवसर से एक नई ऊर्जा, नई प्रेरणा, नई शक्ति, नया सामर्थ्\\u200dय, नया संकल्\\u200dप यह ले करके हम चलेंगे, तो जिन सिद्धियों को प्राप्\\u200dत करना चाहते हैं उन सिद्धियों को हम खुद छू करके देखेंगे, इसी विश्\\u200dवास के साथ मेरी आपको बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएं।\\nधन्यवाद।\\n***\\n\\nDS/ST/TK\\n\"),\n",

Friends,\\nThose present here in the program or watching it on TV can never forget this spectacle in their life. It is unforgettable, wonderful and unprecedented. It is Assam. The entire India is listening to the sounds of the drum, Pepa and Gogona resonating in the sky. Today, the country and the world are watching with great pride the hard work and coordination of thousands of artists from Assam. Firstly, the occasion is so huge and secondly your enthusiasm and spirit is amazing. I remember saying that the day is not far when people will say A to Assam when I came here during the assembly elections. Today, Assam is really becoming an A-One state. I wish the people of Assam and the country a very Happy Bihu. Friends,\\nBaisakhi is also being celebrated in many areas of North India, including Punjab. Bengali sisters and brothers are celebrating Poila Boishakh whereas Vishu festival will be celebrated in Kerala. It is the time of the beginning of the New Year in many states. The festivals we are celebrating are the reflection of the spirit of ‘Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat’. These festivals are an inspiration to fulfil our resolutions of a developed India with ‘Sabka Prayas’ (everyone's efforts). Friends,\\nWith this spirit, many projects related to the development of the North East and Assam have been inaugurated and their foundation stones laid here. Today, Assam and the North East have received AIIMS Guwahati and three new medical colleges as a gift. Today, many projects related to the rail connectivity of the North East have also been started. Today, work has begun on another bridge on the Brahmaputra to improve connectivity. With the construction of a methanol plant, Assam will now be able to export methanol to neighbouring countries as well. The redevelopment and beautification of Rang Ghar, a symbol of Assamese art, culture and tradition, has also started today. Many congratulations to all of you for this festival of culture and rapid development that we all are celebrating. Brothers and sisters,\\nNow, in a short while, the entire country is going to witness the cultural spectacle. When I went among you, I could feel its flavour. What a magnificent spectacle! This is a great example of ‘Sabka Prayas’ (everyone's effort). Assamese have preserved their culture very carefully. I congratulate you a lot for this effort. Words will fall short to praise all the colleagues who have participated in this cultural festival. Our festivals are not just a celebration of culture. Rather, they are also an inspiration to connect everyone and move forward together. This is the eternal spirit of Rongali (Bohag) Bihu. It is a festival of heart and soul for the people of Assam. It bridges every gap and erases every difference. It is the best symbol of harmony between man and nature. Therefore, no one can understand Bihu only in literal sense. Rather, feelings are required to understand it. The same feeling comes from 'Kopou Phool' decorated in the hair of sisters and daughters, Moga silk, Mekhela Sador and Riha. This feeling is also felt by the special dishes prepared in every household today. Friends,\\nThe characteristic of India is that our culture and traditions have been connecting every Indian for thousands of years. Together, we withstood every onslaught of the long period of slavery. Together, we faced the harshest attacks on our culture and civilization. Governments changed, rulers came and went, but India remained immortal and firm. The mind of Indians is made of our soil and culture. And this is also the strong foundation stone for building a developed India today. Friends,\\nI am reminded of a famous song written by Jyoti Prasad Agarwala, the famous litterateur and filmmaker of Assam. It is ‘Biswa Bijoy Nabajuwan’. This song has another specialty. Bharat Ratna Bhupen Hazarika ji sang this song when he was very young. Even today, this song is a great inspiration for the youth of Assam and the country. I would like to quote a few lines of this song, but I hope you will forgive me if there is any mistake in pronunciation. I hope you will not be angry. Indeed, the people of Assam have a very big heart. Friends,\\nThis song is:\\n“बिस्सा बिजोई नौ जोआन, बिस्सा बिजोई नौ जोआन, होक्ति हालि भारोटोर, उलाई आहा - उलाई आहा !!!! होन्टान टुमि बिप्लोबोर, होमुख होमो होमुखोटे, मुक्टि जोजारु हूसियार, मृट्यु बिजोय कोरिबो लागिबो, साधीनाता खुलि डुआर” !!!!\"),\n",

But it is also necessary to tell its meaning to those who are watching this program across the country what is in the veins of Assam, in the heart of Assam, in the mind of the young generation of Assam. In this song, an appeal has been made to the youth of India. The victorious youth of India, listen to the call of Mother India. This song calls upon the youth to be the agents of change. This song assures that we will conquer death and open the door to freedom. Friends,\\nThis song was written when freedom was the biggest dream of India. India is free today and building a developed India is the biggest dream of all of us. We have got the privilege to live for the country. I would appeal to the youth of the country and Assam – the youth of India have the potential to conquer the world. Go ahead, take over the reins of development at a fast pace and open the doors of a developed India. Friends,\\nMany people ask me how do I set such big goals and on whose confidence I talk about a developed India. The answer is very simple. A voice emanating from within says that I have faith in you, I have faith in the youth of the country, I have faith in 140 crore countrymen. It is our government's endeavour to remove every obstacle in your way as soon as possible.\"),\n",

The projects which were inaugurated or their foundation stones laid today exemplify this. Brothers and sisters,\\nFor decades, connectivity in our country was perceived in a very narrow manner. Connectivity meant how a person reaches from one place to another. The people of Assam and the North East know very well India's situation in this regard. In the last nine years, we have changed that old approach regarding connectivity. Connectivity for us today is a ‘Mahayagya’ working together in four directions. The connectivity on which the country is working today has four dimensions – Physical Connectivity, Digital Connectivity, Social Connectivity and Cultural Connectivity. Friends,\\nSince such a wonderful event has taken place here today, therefore, I would like to talk about cultural connectivity first. Unprecedented work has been done in India regarding cultural connectivity in the last few years. Who else could have imagined that there would be such a huge event in Delhi on the 400th birth anniversary of Lachit Borphukan, the great warrior of Assam? Hundreds of people from Assam went to Delhi for that event and I also had the opportunity to interact with them. Friends,\\nBe it Veer Lachit Borphukan or Rani Gaidinliu, be it Kashi-Tamil Sangamam or Saurashtra-Tamil Sangamam, be it Kedarnath or Kamakhya, be it Dosa or Doi Sira, today every idea, every culture is being united with others. Himanta ji recently attended the Madhavpur fair in Gujarat. This bond of Krishna-Rukmani also connects Western India with the North East. Along with Moga Silk, Tezpur Litchi, Joha Rice, Boka Chaul, Kaji Nemu, our Gamosa has also got GI tag. This is also an attempt to take the Assamese art and enterprise of our sisters to the rest of the country. Brothers and sisters,\\nToday, the dialogue of different cultures of the country is also taking place through tourism. Wherever tourists go, they not only spend money there, but also take the culture of that place with them in their memories. But how could different cultures connect in the absence of physical connectivity in the North East? Therefore, our emphasis is also on rail, road and air connectivity. In the last nine years, we have expanded connectivity at a rapid pace to those people who remained disconnected for a long time. Today most of the villages in the North East are also connected by all-weather roads. Many new airports have been built in the North East in the last nine years and commercial flights introduced for the first time. In the last nine years, broad gauge trains have reached Manipur and Tripura. Today, new rail lines are being laid in the North East three times faster than before. Today, doubling of rail lines is happening in the North East almost 10 times faster than earlier. Today itself, five railway projects have been inaugurated in the North East. More than 6,000 crore rupees have been invested in these projects. These projects are going to accelerate the development of a large part of the North East, including Assam. Rail is reaching a large part of Assam for the first time. Doubling of rail lines will provide easy connectivity to Assam as well as Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura and Nagaland. As a result, goods trains will also be able to reach many new areas. It will now be easier to travel to many places of faith and tourism. Brothers and sisters,\\nI still remember when I came here in 2018 for the inauguration of the Bogibeel Bridge. I also had the privilege of inaugurating the Bhupen Hazarika Dhola-Sadiya Bridge. We are not only completing the projects pending for decades, but are also working on new projects at a fast pace. Today, Assam is reaping the full benefits of the network of bridges over the Brahmaputra which has been built in the last nine years. The silk industry of Sualkuchi will get a major boost with the new bridge which will be built soon. Friends,\\nThe way our double engine government has worked on social connectivity in the last nine years, it has made life easier for crores of people. Today lakhs of villages have become free from open defecation due to the Swachh Bharat Mission. Crores of people have got houses through the PM Awas Yojana. Crores of homes have got light from Saubhagya Yojana. The Ujjwala Yojana has freed crores of mothers and sisters from smoke. Tap water has started reaching crores of homes due to the Jal Jeevan Mission. The Digital India and cheap data have ensured many mobile phone facilities for crores of people of the country. All these houses and families are representing aspirational India. These are the strengths of India which will make the dream of a developed India come true. Brothers and sisters,\\nIt is equally important to have a strong thread of trust for development. Today there is permanent peace everywhere in the North East due to the efforts of the government. Many youths have left the path of violence and joined the path of development. The atmosphere of mistrust is retreating and the gap between hearts is disappearing in the North East. In order to build a developed India in the ‘Amrit Kaal’ of independence, we have to improve this environment further and take it far and wide. We have to move forward together with the spirit of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, Sabka Prayas’. With this wish, I congratulate the countrymen and the people of Assam on this holy festival. Happy New Year to all of you! The Bihu dance by thousands of people, for which you have practised for many days, will take Assam to a new height. I am eagerly waiting for the next program. I will enjoy and so will be the countrymen watching it on TV. I am sure that now you are going to dominate the social media. Speak with me – Bharat Mata Ki Jai. It should resonate far and wide. Bharat Mata Ki Jai! Bharat Mata Ki Jai! Bharat Mata Ki Jai! Vande Matram! Vande Matram! Vande Matram! Vande Matram! Vande Matram! Vande Matram! Vande Matram! Vande Matram! Vande Matram! Vande Matram!

Greetings to all the Ahom people, brothers and sisters from the sacred land of Maa Kamakhya! Wishing you all a very Happy Rongali Bihu! On this auspicious occasion, the health infrastructure of Assam and the North East has got a new boost today. Today, North East got its first AIIMS. And Assam has got three new medical colleges. The foundation stone of a 500-bed super specialty hospital for modern research in collaboration with IIT Guwahati has also been laid. Delivering Ayushman cards to lakhs of friends of Assam has also started on mission mode. Apart from Assam, people from Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Manipur are also going to get a lot of benefits from the new AIIMS. Many congratulations and best wishes to all of you, my brothers and sisters of the North East, for all these health related projects. Brothers and sisters,\\nThere is a lot of buzz about connectivity related infrastructure in the North East in the last nine years. Whoever comes to the North East today is full of praise of the works related to road, rail and airports. However, there is another infrastructure in the North East where commendable work has taken place and that is the social infrastructure. Friends, the expansion of education and health facilities here is truly unprecedented. When I visited Dibrugarh last year, I had the opportunity to lay foundation stones and inaugurate several hospitals simultaneously in several districts of Assam. Today, I have had the privilege of handing over AIIMS and three medical colleges to you. Over the years, the facility of dental colleges has also expanded in Assam. These are also being helped by the ever-improving rail-road connectivity in the North East. In particular, the problems women used to face during pregnancy have now gone away. As a result, the risk to the life of mother and child has been greatly reduced. Nowadays, one notices the emergence of a new disease. Wherever I go in the country, in the North, in the South, in the North East, I discuss the development works in the last nine years. However, some people get very upset.'),\n",

They complain that they too have ruled the country for decades, so why don't they get credit? Credit hungry people and the spirit of ruling the public have done a lot of harm to the country. Public is the form of God. They were credit-hungry, therefore, the North East seemed distant to them and they created a sense of alienation. We keep serving you with the spirit of service, with the spirit of being your ‘Sevak’ and with dedication. And therefore, the North East does not seem far away to us and the sense of belonging never contracts. I am happy that today the people of the North East have taken upon themselves the reins of development. They are moving forward with the mantra of the development of North East to India's development. In this new movement of development, the central government is working with all the states as a friend, as a ‘sevak’ and as a partner. Today's event is also a living example of this. Friends,\\nOur Northeast has been grappling with so many challenges for several decades. When politics of nepotism, regionalism, corruption and instability dominate a sector, then it becomes impossible for development to take place. And that's what happened to our healthcare system. The AIIMS in Delhi was built in the 50s. People from every corner of the country used to come to Delhi AIIMS for treatment. But for decades, no one thought that AIIMS should be established in other parts of the country as well. Atal ji’s government made efforts in this regard for the first time. But everything came to a standstill after the change of his government. Even in the AIIMS that were set up, they remained in a dilapidated condition. We removed all these shortcomings after 2014. We started work on 15 new AIIMS in the last few years. In most of these AIIMS, facilities for both treatment and education have started. AIIMS Guwahati is also an example of the fact that whatever resolution our government takes, it fulfils it as well. It is the affection of the people of Assam that draws me here time and again. Your affection called me here even at the time of foundation stone laying ceremony and today I have got the opportunity to inaugurate it on the pious occasion of Bihu. This is your love.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'English_rendering_of_PM’s_address_at_ina.txt', 'Ministry': 'Prime_Ministers_Office', 'Month': 'Apr23html'}, page_content=\"Friends,\\nWe have had a severe shortage of doctors and other medical professionals due to the policies of the previous governments. This deficiency was a major barrier to quality health service in India. Therefore, our government has worked on a large scale to increase medical infrastructure and medical professionals in the last nine years. In the 10 years before 2014, only about 150 medical colleges were built. In the last nine years, about 300 new medical colleges have been built during our rule. MBBS seats in the country have also doubled to more than one lakh in the last nine years. There has also been an increase of 110 per cent in the number of PG seats in medicine in the country in the last nine years. We have established the National Medical Commission for the expansion of medical education. We have also extended the facility of reservation to backward families so that their children can become doctors. For the first time, we have given the option of medical studies in Indian languages so that children from remote areas can also become doctors. An announcement has also been made in this year's budget to open more than 150 nursing colleges. If I talk about the North East, then the number of medical colleges has more than doubled here in the last nine years. Work is in progress at many medical colleges. Many new medical colleges are going to be built here. In the last nine years, the number of medical seats in the North East has also doubled as compared to earlier. Brothers and sisters,\\nToday, if so much work is happening in the health sector in India, it is because you formed a stable and strong government in 2014. The policy, intention and loyalty in the BJP governments are not based on any selfishness, but our policies are motivated by the spirit of Nation First, Countrymen First. That's why we focused on mitigating the problems of the people of the country rather than eyeing the vote bank. We decided that our sisters do not have to travel far for treatment. We decided that no poor person should have to postpone his treatment due to lack of money. We tried to ensure that our poor families also get better treatment near their homes. Friends,\\nI know how much the poor worry about not having money for treatment. Therefore, our government started the Ayushman Yojana, which provides free treatment up to Rs 5 lakh. I know how much the poor and middle class people are anxious by expensive medicines. Therefore, our government opened more than 9,000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras and hundreds of affordable medicines were made available at these centres. I know how much the poor and middle class people were spending on heart and knee surgeries. Therefore, our government controlled the prices of stents and knee implants. I know the concern of the poor when they need dialysis. Therefore, our government started a scheme of free dialysis in every district, and as a result, lakhs of people benefited from it. I know how important it is to detect serious illness in time. That's why our government has opened more than 1.5 lakh health and wellness centres across the country, where necessary tests are being provided. I know that TB disease has been a huge challenge for the poor for decades. Therefore, our government started the Pradhan Mantri TB Mukt Bharat campaign. We have set a target of eliminating TB five years before the rest of the world. I know how any disease destroys poor and middle class families. Therefore, our government focused on preventive health care by ensuring that diseases do not occur. We have continuously made people aware of health by popularising Yoga-Ayurveda and the Fit India campaign. Friends,\\nToday, when I see the success of these government schemes, I consider myself blessed that God and the people have blessed me to serve the poor so much. The Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana has proved to be a major support for crores of poor people of the country today. In the past few years, the Ayushman Bharat scheme has saved the poor from spending Rs 80,000 crore. Due to Jan Aushadhi Kendras, the poor and middle class people have been saved from spending Rs 20,000 crore. The poor and middle class people are saving Rs 13,000 crore every year due to the reduction in the cost of stents and knee implants. With the facility of free dialysis, poor kidney patients have been saved from spending more than Rs 500 crore. Today, the campaign to give Ayushman Bharat cards to more than one crore citizens of Assam has also started. The people of Assam are going to get a lot of help from this campaign and their money will be saved. Friends,\\nI often meet the beneficiaries of the schemes of our government in every nook and corner of the country. A large number of our mothers and sisters, sons and daughters, participate in this exchange. They tell me that there has been a huge difference in health facilities during the previous governments and now during the BJP government. You and I know that when it comes to health and treatment, our women are often left behind. Our mothers and sisters feel why to spend household money on their treatment and why to trouble others. The health of crores of women of the country was affected due to lack of resources and financial constraints. The schemes started by our BJP-led government have greatly benefited our mothers and sisters and the health of women. Crores of toilets built under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan have saved women from many diseases. The gas connection under the Ujjwala scheme has freed the women from the deadly fumes. Crores of women have been saved from water-borne diseases with water available to every household under the Jal Jeevan Mission. The Mission Indradhanush has saved crores of women from serious diseases by giving them free vaccination. The Ayushman Bharat Yojana has assured women free hospital treatment up to Rs 5 lakh. The Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana has ensured financial help to women during pregnancy. The Rashtriya Poshan Abhiyan has helped in providing nutritious food to women. This is how work is done when the government is sensitive and when there is a feeling of service towards the poor. Friends,\\nOur government is also modernizing India's health sector according to the needs of the 21st century. Today, digital health IDs are being given to the countrymen under the Ayushman Bharat Digital Health Mission. Hospitals and health professionals across the country are being brought on a single platform. With this facility, the complete health record of the citizens of the country will be available on just one click. This will help treatment in hospitals and it will be easy to reach the right doctor. I am happy that so far about 38 crore digital IDs have been created under this scheme. So far, more than two lakh health facilities and more than 1.5 lakh health professionals have been verified. Today, e-Sanjeevani is also becoming the preferred medium of treatment for people sitting at home. About 10 crore friends across the country have taken advantage of this facility. This is ensuring saving of both time and money. Brothers and sisters,\\nThe major basis for change in India's healthcare system is ‘Sabka Prayas’ (everyone's effort). We have witnessed the power of ‘Sabka Prayas’ during the Corona crisis. Today the world is praising the world's biggest, fastest and most effective Covid vaccination campaign. We made Made in India vaccines and delivered them far and wide within a short span of time. Everyone from ASHA workers, Anganwadi workers and primary healthcare workers to the pharmaceutical sector did a wonderful job. Such a big Mahayagya becomes successful only when there is ‘Sabka Prayas’ and ‘Sabka Vishwas’. We have to move forward with the spirit of ‘Sabka Prayas’. Let us take forward the mission of Healthy India and Prosperous India with ‘Sabka Prayas’. Once again, I congratulate the people of Assam for AIIMS and medical colleges. I thank you for your love that you came in such large numbers to bless me. With this, I end my speech. DISCLAIMER: This is the approximate translation of PM’s speech.

Bharat Mata Ki Jai! Governor of Telangana Tamilisai Soundararajan ji; my Cabinet colleague Shri Ashwini Vaishnaw ji; son of Telangana and my colleague in the Council of Ministers Shri G. Kishan Reddy ji, my dear brothers and sisters from Telangana who have come in large numbers! My heartfelt greetings to you all! I salute Telangana, the land of great revolutionaries. Today, I once again have got the privilege of giving further impetus to the development of Telangana. A short while back, another Vande Bharat train connecting Telangana and Andhra Pradesh has been flagged off. This modern train will now connect the city of Bhagyalakshmi Temple with Lord Sri Venkateswara Dham Tirupati. That is, in a way, this Vande Bharat Express is going to link devotion, modernity, technology and tourism. Besides this, projects worth more than Rs 11,000 crore have been inaugurated and the foundation stones have been laid here today. These are projects related to rail and road connectivity and health infrastructure of Telangana. I congratulate you, the people of Telangana, and wish you all the best for all these development projects. Friends,\\n\\n\\nThe time that has passed since Telangana became a separate state is almost the same as the NDA government's regime at the Centre. Today, once again, I respectfully bow down to the crores of people who have contributed to the formation of Telangana, i.e. the ordinary citizens here. The NDA government at the centre considers it its duty to fulfil the dream of the people of Telangana regarding the development of Telangana and its people. We are moving forward with the mantra of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, Sabka Prayas'. We have tried our best to ensure that Telangana also gets the most out of the new model of India's development that has evolved in the last 9 years. One example of this is the development of our cities. In the last 9 years, about 70 kilometres of metro network has been built in Hyderabad itself. Work on the Hyderabad Multi-Modal Transport System - MMTS project has also progressed rapidly during this period. Even today 13 MMTS services have started here. For rapid expansion of MMTS, Rs 600 crore has been allocated to Telangana in this year's central government budget. This will further facilitate lakhs of friends from Hyderabad, Secunderabad and surrounding districts. With this, new business hubs will be created and investment will begin to flow in new areas. Friends,\\n\\n\\nToday, amidst the worst pandemic\\xa0in 100 years and the war between the two countries, the economies of the world are fluctuating at a rapid pace. Amid this uncertainty, India is one of the countries in the world which is making record investments to modernize its infrastructure. In this year's budget Rs 10 lakh crore has been allocated for modern infra. Today's new India, the new India of the 21st century, is rapidly building modern infrastructure in every corner of the country. In Telangana too, the railway budget has been increased by almost 17 times in the last 9 years. Just now Ashwini ji was telling us the figures. Be it the work of laying new railway lines, the work of doubling of railway lines, or the work of electrification, everything has been done at a record speed. The doubling work of the rail line between Secunderabad and Mahabubnagar which has been completed today is an example of the same. This will also improve the connectivity of Hyderabad and Bengaluru. Telangana is also getting the benefit of the efforts to modernize major railway stations across the country. The development of Secunderabad Railway Station is also a part of this effort. Friends,\\n\\n\\nBesides the railways, the network of highways in Telangana is also being developed at a rapid pace by the central government. Today the foundation stones of 4 highway projects have been laid here. Be it the Akkalkot-Kurnool section at a cost of Rs 2300 crores, Mahbubnagar-Chincholi section at a cost of Rs 1300 crores, Kalwakurthy-Kollapur highway at a cost of about Rs 900 crores, or the Khammam-Devarapalli section to be done at a cost of Rs 2700 crores,\\xa0 the central government is working with all its might for the construction of modern National Highways in Telangana. Due to the relentless efforts of the Central Government, today the length of National Highways in Telangana has doubled. When Telangana was formed in the year 2014, there were around 2500 kilometres of national highways. Today the length of National Highways in Telangana has increased to 5000 kms. In these years, the Central Government has spent about Rs 35 thousand crores for the construction of National Highway in Telangana. Even now, work is going on in Telangana on road projects worth Rs 60 thousand crore. This also includes the game-changer Hyderabad Ring Road project. Friends,\\nThe central government is emphasizing on the development of both industry and agriculture in Telangana. Textile is one such industry, which helps both the farmer as well as the labourer. Our government has decided to set up 7 mega textile parks across the country. One of these mega textile parks will also be built in Telangana. This will create new employment opportunities for the youth. Besides employment, the central government is also investing a lot on education and health in Telangana. Our government has got the privilege of establishing AIIMS in Telangana. Work has also started today on different facilities related to AIIMS Bibinagar. Today's projects will improve Ease of Travel, Ease of Living and Ease of Doing Business in Telangana. But friends,\\n\\n\\nIn the midst of these efforts of the Central Government, I am very pained due to one thing. Due to lack of cooperation from the state government in most of the central projects, every project is getting delayed. As a result, the people of Telangana are suffering. I request the state government not to allow any hindrance in the works related to development and to speed up the development projects. Brothers & Sisters,\\n\\n\\nIn today's new India, it is the priority of our government to fulfil the hopes, aspirations and dreams of the countrymen. We are working hard day and night.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'English_rendering_of_PM’s_address_at_lau.txt', 'Ministry': 'Prime_Ministers_Office', 'Month': 'Apr23html'}, page_content=\"But a handful of people are perturbed by these works of development. Such people, who nurtured dynastic-rule, nepotism and corruption, are facing problems from those who do honest work. Such people have nothing to do with the interest of the country and the welfare of the society. These people just like to see their clan flourish. In every project, in every investment, these people see the interest of their family. Telangana needs to be very careful with such people. Brothers & Sisters,\\n\\n\\nCorruption and nepotism are not separate from each other. Where there is dynastic-rule and nepotism, all kinds of corruption start flourishing from there. The main mantra of dynastic-rule is that a family or dynasty is to control everything. They want to keep their control over every system. They do not like it at all when someone challenges their control. Let me give you an example. Today, the Central Government has developed the Direct Benefit Transfer- DBT system. Today farmers, students, and small businessmen get financial assistance money directly to their bank accounts. We have expanded the system of digital payments across the country. Why couldn't this happen earlier? This did not happen because the dynastic forces did not want to give up their control over the system. These people wanted to keep the control of 'which beneficiary would get what benefit and how much'. By this, their three interests were served. One, the family could continue to garner praises. Secondly, the corruption money would keep coming to this particular family only. And thirdly, the money that was supposed to be sent to the poor would get distributed within their corrupt ecosystem. Today Modi has attacked this real root of corruption. Tell me brothers and sisters of Telangana, will you answer? Will you answer? Should we fight against corruption or not? Should we fight against the corrupt or not? Should the country be freed from corruption or not? No matter how big the corrupt is, should legal steps be taken or not? Should the law be allowed to work against the corrupt or not? And that's why these people are shaken, and they are doing anything and everything out of frustration. A few days ago, many such political parties approached the court for protection, lest anyone exposes their corrupt activities. They went to the court but the court gave them a jolt. Brothers & Sisters,\\n\\n\\nWhen work is done with the spirit of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas', then democracy is strengthened in true sense and the deprived-exploited-oppressed get priority. And this was the dream of Babasaheb Ambedkar. This is the true spirit of the Constitution. When the central government was freed from the shackles of dynastic-rule in 2014, the whole country witnessed what the result was. In the last 9 years, 11 crore mothers, sisters and daughters of the country have got the facility of a toilet or 'Izzatghar'. Out of that, mothers and sisters of more than 30 lakh families of Telangana have also got this facility. In the last 9 years, more than 9 crore sisters and daughters in the country have got free Ujjwala gas connections. More than 11 lakh poor families of Telangana have also got its benefits. Friends,\\n\\n\\nDynastic-rule used to rob crores of poor friends of the country including Telangana of even their ration. Today 80 crore poor people are being provided free ration by our government. Due to this, lakhs of poor people of Telangana have also been benefitted tremendously. Due to the policies of our government, lakhs of poor people of Telangana have got the facility of free treatment up to Rs.5 lakh. For the first time Jan Dhan bank accounts of 1 crore families of Telangana have been opened. 2.5 lakh small entrepreneurs of Telangana have got Mudra loans without bank guarantee. Here 5 lakh street-vendors have got bank loans for the first time. More than 40 lakh small farmers of Telangana also got about Rs 9000 crore under PM Kisan Samman Nidhi. This is that deprived class, which has got this priority for the first time. Friends,\\nWhen the country moves away from appeasement towards ensuring satisfaction for all, that is when true social justice is born. Today, the whole country including Telangana wants to walk on the path of contentment and wants to develop with everyone's efforts. Even today, the projects that Telangana has got are inspired by the spirit of ensuring satisfaction and are dedicated to the development of all. Rapid development of Telangana is very important for building a developed India in 'Azaadi Ka Amritkaal'. The coming 25 years are also very important for Telangana. Keeping away from every negative force such as appeasement of people and corruption will determine the fate of Telangana. We have to fulfil all the dreams of Telangana's development together. Once again, I congratulate my dear brothers and sisters of Telangana for all these projects. It is a matter of great joy for me that you have come in such large numbers to bless us for the bright future and development of Telangana. I express my heartfelt gratitude to you.

Before I say something, I would like to tell you a joke which I heard in my childhood. There was a professor and his daughter committed suicide and left a note saying that she was tired of her life and did not want to live any more. She wrote that she would consume something and jump into the Kankaria Lake and die. The next morning, the professor found that his daughter was not at home. Her father went to her room and found a letter. He became very angry after reading the letter. He said, ‘I am Professor, I worked hard for so many years and still her spelling of Kankaria is wrongly written in the suicide letter.’ I am happy that Arnab has started speaking better Hindi. I did not hear what he said, but I was paying equal attention to whether his Hindi is correct or not. Perhaps, your Hindi has improved after living in Mumbai. Friends,\\nI really enjoy being with you. Republic TV is completing six years next month. I would like to congratulate you for not letting your mission of Nation First waver. You persevered in spite of all kinds of hurdles and obstacles. Sometimes Arnab's throat got sore and sometimes some people tried to catch hold of him by his throat, but the channel did not stop. Neither it was exhausted, nor paused. Friends,\\nWhen I came to the Republic Summit in 2019, the theme at that time was 'India's Moment'. In the background of this theme was the mandate that we received from the people of the country. The people of India had formed a stable government for the second consecutive time with a thumping majority after several decades. The country was convinced that 'India's Moment' had arrived. Today, after four years, the theme of your summit is ‘Time of Transformation’. That is, the trust behind that transformation is now visible on the ground. Friends,\\nOne way to measure the direction of change that is taking place in the country today is the pace of growth and expansion of the economy. It took almost 60 years for India to become a one trillion dollar economy. Sixty years! By 2014, we somehow managed to reach the two trillion dollar mark. That is a two trillion dollar economy in seven decades! But today, India is a country with an economy of about 3.5 trillion dollars in just nine years of the formation of our government. We made a quantum jump from number 10 to become the fifth largest economy in the world in the last nine years. And all this happened in the midst of the biggest crisis of 100 years. At a time when the world's biggest economies were stuck, India not only came out of the crisis, but is moving forward at a fast pace. Friends,\\nYou must have often heard one thing from policy makers – First order impact. That is the first and natural result of any policy. First order impact is the first goal of the policy, and its impact is seen in a short time. But every policy also has second and third order impacts. Their impact is deep, far reaching, but it takes time to unfold. We have to go back several decades to do its comparative study, to understand in detail. The people of the world of TV run two windows – then and now. I am also going to do something similar today.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'English_rendering_of_PM’s_address_at_Rep.txt', 'Ministry': 'Prime_Ministers_Office', 'Month': 'Apr23html'}, page_content=\"So first let's talk about the past. Friends,\\nThe government itself became the controller in the economic policy of license raj that was adopted after independence. Competition was abolished and the private industry and MSMEs were not allowed to flourish. The first negative effect of this was that we kept lagging behind in comparison to other countries and became poorer. The second order effect of those policies was even worse. India's consumption growth remained very low as compared to the world. As a result, the manufacturing sector weakened and we lost investment opportunities. The third effect of this policy was that an atmosphere of innovation could not develop in India. In such a situation, neither more innovative enterprises were created, nor private jobs created. The youth started relying only on government jobs. Many talents of the country even decided to leave the country in the absence of the working environment. All these consequences were the result of the third order impact of the same government policies. The impact of those policies crushed the country's capacity for innovation, hard work and enterprise. Friends,\\nNow what I am going to tell you, the viewers of Republic TV will definitely like it. Whatever policy our government formulated after 2014, not only the initial benefits were taken care of, but second and third order effects were also given priority. You will recall that I mentioned giving houses to 1.5 crore families in five years under the PM Awas Yojana during the 2019 Republic Summit. Now this figure has jumped to more than 3.75 crore houses. The ownership rights of most of these houses are in the name of our mothers and sisters. And you know that today each house which is built is worth lakhs of rupees. Today I say with great satisfaction that crores of poor sisters have become ‘Lakhpati Didi’. Perhaps there can be no greater Raksha Bandhan than this! This is the first impact. The second impact of this was that lakhs of employment opportunities were created in villages under this scheme. And you know that when someone has a house of his own, a permanent house, then his confidence gets a boost and his risk-taking capacity also increases. His dreams start touching the sky. The PM Awas Yojana has raised the confidence of the country's poor to a new height. Friends,\\nMudra Yojana has completed eight years just a few days ago. This scheme was launched to provide financial support to micro and small entrepreneurs. More than 40 crore loans have been disbursed under the Mudra scheme, of which about 70 per cent are women. The first effect of this scheme is in front of us in the form of an increase in self-employment. Be it Mudra Yojana, opening of Jan Dhan accounts of women or promotion of self-help groups, today we can see a big social change taking place in the country through these schemes. These schemes have established a strong role of women in the decision-making process of the family today. Now more and more women are becoming job creators and giving strength to the growing economy of the country. Friends,\\nIn the PM Svamitva Yojana also, you can see first, second and third order impact separately. Under this, property cards were given to the poor using the latest technology, which gave them the assurance of property security. One effect of this scheme can be seen on the drone sector where the demand and expansion possibilities are continuously increasing. It has been almost two to two-and-a-half years since the PM Svamitva Yojana was launched, not much time has passed, but its social impact is also visible. The possibility of mutual dispute has reduced after getting the property card. This will reduce the ever-increasing pressure on our police and judicial system. It has now become easier for those who have got property papers in the villages to get financial help from banks. The price of these properties in the villages has also increased. Friends,\\nI have so many case studies of first order, second order and third order impact that your TV’s ‘rundown’ will be out of order and a lot of time will be spent in this. Be it DBT, plans to provide facilities like electricity, water, toilets to poor people, all these have brought a revolution at the ground level. These schemes have given even the poorest of the poor in the country a sense of respect and security. For the first time in the country, the poor have got security as well as dignity. Those who were made to realize for decades that they were a burden on the development of the country, today they are speeding up the development of the country. When the government launched these schemes, some people used to make fun of us. But today these schemes have given pace to India's rapid development and have become the basis for building a developed India. Friends,\\nEveryone from the poor, Dalit, deprived, backward, tribal, general class or middle class has been experiencing a visible change in their lives since the last nine years. Today the country is moving ahead with a very systematic approach and on mission mode. We have also changed the mindset of those in power. We have introduced the mindset of service. We have made the welfare of the poor our medium. Instead of appeasement, we have made satisfaction our base. This approach has created a defensive shield for the poor and middle class of the country. This protective shield has prevented the poor of the country from becoming poorer. Very few of you will know that the Ayushman Yojana has saved the poor of the country from spending 80,000 crore rupees which otherwise had to be spent from their pockets. If this scheme was not there, the poor would have had to spend the same amount from their own pocket. Imagine, we have saved so many poor people from becoming poorer. This is not the only scheme that comes in handy in times of crisis. Rather, crores of families have also got the facilities of affordable medicines, free vaccinations, free dialysis, accident insurance and life insurance for the first time. The PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana is another protective shield for a large population of the country. This scheme did not allow any poor to sleep hungry during the Corona crisis. Today the government is spending four lakh crore rupees on this food scheme. Whether it is ‘One Nation One Ration Card’ or our ‘JAM Trinity’, all these are part of the protective shield. Today, the poorest of the poor are assured that they will definitely get what is due to them. And I believe that this is social justice in the true sense. There are many such schemes which have made a huge impact in reducing poverty in India. You must have seen the IMF report some time back. This report says that extreme poverty in India is on the verge of ending due to such schemes and despite the pandemic. This is transformation.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'English_rendering_of_PM’s_address_at_Rep.txt', 'Ministry': 'Prime_Ministers_Office', 'Month': 'Apr23html'}, page_content=\"What is transformation otherwise? Friends,\\nYou would recount I had identified MNREGA in Parliament as a monument of the failures of the Congress government. There were so many complaints about MNREGA before 2014. Our government conducted a study in this regard. The study revealed that the attendance of up to 30 days was being shown against one day's work in several instances. In other words, someone else was pilfering the money. Who was losing? It was the poor and labourers who were losing. Even today, if you go to the villages and ask which project made under MNREGA before 2014 is still functioning, you will hardly find anything. Earlier, there was very little emphasis on Permanent Asset Development while spending money on MNREGA. We also changed this situation. We increased the budget of MNREGA as well as transparency. We started sending money directly to the bank accounts of the people and also created resources for the villages. After 2014, lakhs of pucca houses for the poor, wells, step wells, canals, animal sheds, etc. have been made under MNREGA. Today, most MNREGA payments are cleared within 15 days. Now the Aadhaar cards of more than 90 percent MNREGA workers have been linked. This has reduced forgery in job cards. And I'll give you another statistic. About 40,000 crore rupees have been saved from going into the wrong hands due to fraud prevention in MNREGA. Now the MNREGA money is going to that poor labourer, who works hard and sheds his sweat. Our government has ended the injustice being meted to the poor. Friends,\\nThis journey of transformation is as contemporary as it is futuristic. Today we are preparing for many decades to come. Whatever technology came in the past, it reached India after several decades or years. India has also changed this trend in the last nine years. India started three tasks simultaneously. Firstly, we freed the sectors related to technology from the control of the government. Second, we insisted on developing technology in India according to India's needs. Third, we adopted a mission mode approach on research and development for the technology of the future. Today you can see how fast 5G has been rolled out in the country. We have grown at the fastest pace in the world. The speed that India has shown regarding 5G, the way India has developed its own technology, is being discussed all over the world. Friends,\\nNo one can forget the issue of vaccines in the Corona era. The people with old thinking and approach doubted the need of ‘Made in India’ vaccines. Their common refrain was that other countries were developing the vaccines so they will give us the vaccines one day or the other. But even in times of crisis, India chose the path of self-reliance and the results are in front of us. And friends, today you are very happy. But imagine when we had to make the decision during that time. You put yourself in that position when the world was saying that take our vaccines, people were saying trouble is in store without vaccines and we will die. The editorials and TV debates were highlighting the dangers. They were clamouring to bring the vaccines. Friends, I had taken a big political capital risk only for my country. Otherwise, I could also say that I should use the treasury and import the vaccines. Vaccinate people once and advertise in newspapers and it will be over. But friends, we did not choose that path. We developed the world's best and effective vaccines in a very short time. We quickly launched the world's largest and most successful vaccine campaign. And you would recall that Covid started spreading in India in January-February and India had formed a task force for the vaccines by the month of May. We made plans in advance keeping in view the requirements of the future. And this was also the time when some people were engaged in renouncing the ‘Made in India’ vaccines. What kinds of words were used? I don't know whose pressure was there? I don't know what was the self-interest that these people were advocating for the import of foreign vaccines? Friends,\\nOur Digital India campaign is also discussed worldwide today. Recently, I went to Bali for the G-20 Summit. There was hardly any country which did not try to know the details of Digital India from me. There was also an attempt to derail Digital India at one time. Earlier, the country was embroiled in the debate of data vs Atta (flour). And these TV media people enjoy it a lot, they put two words – you need data or Atta. What tricks they did not employ from the Parliament to the court in stopping the trinity of Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile. They would make fun of me when I used to tell the countrymen in 2016 that the bank would be on their fingertips. Some pseudo intellectuals used to ask me ‘Modi ji, tell me, how will the poor buy potatoes and tomatoes digitally?’ And what did these people say later? ‘Where are potatoes and tomatoes in the fortune of the poor?’ These are the kind of people. They even said that fairs are held in the villages, how will people make digital payments in the fairs? Today you see for yourself whether digital payments are happening in your Film City from the tea shop to the litti-chokha cart or not? Today India is among those countries where digital transactions take place the most, as compared to the world. Friends,\\nYou must be wondering why the government was doing so much work or whether people on the ground were also getting its benefits. Yet, there are some people who have problems with Modi. It is followed by the media. And today I want to tell the reasons for this to the viewers of Republic TV. The anger that is visible, the ruckus that is taking place, is because Modi has closed the avenues of black income for some people forever. Now there is no half-hearted or isolated approach in the fight against corruption. Now there is an integrated, institutionalised approach. This is our commitment. Now you tell me, will those whose tainted wealth is stopped abuse me or not? They also effuse poison in their writings. You would be surprised to know that around 10 crore fake beneficiaries of government schemes have been thrown out due to JAM Trinity. The figure is not small, Sir. Ten crore fake beneficiaries have been thrown out. These 10 crore were the people who used to take the benefits of the government schemes. These 10 crore were those who were never even born but government money was being sent to them. You imagine the Congress government was sending money to such a large number of fake beneficiaries which was more than the combined population of Delhi, Punjab and Haryana. If our government had not delisted these 10 crore fake names from the system, the situation could have been far worse. It was not that easy to accomplish this feat, my friends. We had to give constitutional status to Aadhaar first. More than 45 crore Jan Dhan bank accounts were opened on mission mode. So far, 28 lakh crore rupees have been transferred to crores of beneficiaries through DBT. Direct Benefit Transfer means no middleman, no involvement of people making black money. DBT simply means end to commission and pilferage. This one arrangement led to transparency in dozens of schemes and programmes. Friends,\\nGovernment procurement also used to be a major source of corruption in our country. There is now transformation in this too. Government procurement is now done entirely on GeM- i.e. Government e-Marketplace portal. Newspapers used to write excessively on problems related to tax problems. What did we do? We made the system faceless. Arrangements have been made that there should be no face to face between the tax officer and the taxpayer. The GST has also closed the avenues of black money. When there is honest work, it is natural for some people to have problems. And the ones who have problems, will they abuse the people on the streets? Friends, this is why these representatives of corruption are disturbed. They are hell bent to destroy the honest system of the country. Friends,\\nIf their fight was with only Modi, they would have succeeded long ago. But they are not able to succeed in their conspiracies because they do not know that they are fighting against the common Indian. No matter how big an alliance these corrupt people form, no matter all the corrupt people come on one platform, no matter all the dynasty members come at one place, but Modi is not going back. My fight against corruption and nepotism will continue my friends and I am a person who has taken a vow to free the country from these wrongdoings. I need your blessings. Friends,\\nThis ‘Amrit Kaal’ of independence belongs to the efforts of all of us. When the might and hard work of every Indian will be applied, we will be able to fulfil the dream of a developed India as soon as possible. I am sure that Republic Network will continue to strengthen this spirit and now that Arnab has said that he is going global, so India's voice will get a new strength. My best wishes to him also. Now the number of countrymen who tread with honesty is increasing which is the guarantee of grand India. My countrymen are the guarantee of a grand India. I assure you that I believe in that.\"),\n",

Wish you all a very Happy Tamil Puthandu! It is the love and affection of my Tamil brothers and sisters that today I have got an opportunity to celebrate Tamil Puthandu with you. Puthandu is a festival of novelty in antiquity! Such an ancient Tamil culture, and this tradition of moving forward with new energy from Puthandu every year, is really amazing! This is what makes Tamil Nadu and the Tamil people so special. Therefore, I have always had a fascination for this tradition as well as emotional attachment with it. When I was in Gujarat, a large number of people of Tamil origin lived in the Maninagar assembly constituency which I represented as an MLA. They were my voters and they would make me MLA as well as Chief Minister. And I always cherish the moments I spent with them. It is my good fortune that the people of Tamil Nadu have reciprocated my love for Tamil Nadu in greater measure. Friends,\\nI had spoken about taking pride in our heritage during my address from the ramparts of Red Fort on the completion of 75 years of independence of the country. The more ancient it is, the more time tested it is. Therefore, both Tamil culture and Tamil people are eternal in nature as well as global. From Chennai to California, from Madurai to Melbourne, from Coimbatore to Cape Town, from Salem to Singapore, you will find Tamil people, who have carried with them their culture and traditions. Be it Pongal or Puthandu, they are marked all over the world. Tamil is the world's oldest language. Every Indian is proud of this. Tamil literature is also widely respected. The Tamil film industry has given some of the most iconic works to us. Friends,\\nThe contribution of people of Tamil Nadu has also been very important in the freedom struggle. After independence, the talent of the people of Tamil Nadu has given new heights to the country even in the reconstruction of the country. Can the talk of modern India be complete without C. Rajagopalachari and his philosophy? We still remember Kamaraj and his efforts related to social welfare. Which youth would not be inspired by Dr. Kalam? The contribution of Tamil people in the fields of medicine, law and academics is incomparable. I have often discussed the contributions of the people of Tamil Nadu in 'Mann Ki Baat' episodes. Friends,\\nIndia is the oldest democracy in the world. It is the Mother of Democracy. There are many historical references and many irrefutable evidences to this fact. One of these important references is also of Tamil Nadu. The place named Uttaramerur in Tamil Nadu is very special. Here, many things about India's democratic values have been written on an inscription from 1100 to 1200 years ago which can be read even today. The inscription found here is like a local constitution for the Gram Sabha at that time. It mentions how the assembly should be run, what should be the qualifications of the members and what should be the process of electing the members. Moreover, it also talks about disqualification of members even in that era. Democracy is described in great detail in that system which existed hundreds of years ago. Friends,\\nThere is so much in Tamil culture that has shaped India as a nation. For example, we have Venkatesa Perumal Temple at Thiru Mukkoodal near Kanchipuram, 70 kms away from Chennai. This temple built during the Chola Empire is also about 1100 years old. It is written on granite stones of this temple that a 15-bed hospital existed at that time. The inscriptions on the 1100 years old stones mention medical procedures, doctors’ salaries, herbal drugs etc. These inscriptions related to healthcare are a great heritage of Tamil Nadu and India. Friends,\\nI remember mentioning the ancient Shiva temple in Tiruvarur district when I went to Tamil Nadu for the inauguration of the Chess Olympiad. This very ancient Chathuranga Vallabhanathar temple is associated with the game of chess. Similarly, there are numerous references to trade from Tamil Nadu to other countries during the Chola Empire. Brothers and sisters,\\nIt was our responsibility as a nation to take this legacy forward and proudly present it to the world.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'English_rendering_of_PM’s_address_at_Tam.txt', 'Ministry': 'Prime_Ministers_Office', 'Month': 'Apr23html'}, page_content=\"But you know what happened in the past. Now, you have given me the good fortune to do this service. I remember many people from the country and the world messaged me and expressed their happiness when I quoted from a Tamil text in the Tamil language in the United Nations. I had the opportunity to visit Jaffna in Sri Lanka. I was the first Prime Minister of India to visit Jaffna. The people there were waiting for help for a long time for the welfare of the Tamil community in Sri Lanka. Our government did many things for them, including building houses for the Tamil people. A very interesting event also took place when the housewarming ceremony was taking place there. According to the Tamil tradition, milk is boiled on wood outside the house before the ‘Griha Pravesh’ ceremony. I took part in that ceremony too and I remember the people showered me with so much love when the video of that ceremony was seen by people in Tamil Nadu. On every step, you will find how much I am connected with Tamil Nadu and with the Tamil people. This spirit of continuing to serve the Tamil people gives me new energy. Friends,\\nYou are all aware of the success of the recently concluded 'Kashi Tamil Sangamam'. We celebrated antiquity, novelty and diversity together in this program. The richness of Tamil literature was also brought to the fore in these events. During the Tamil Sangamam in Kashi, Tamil language books worth thousands of rupees were sold within a short period of time. There was also a tremendous craze for books teaching Tamil language. Friends, Hindi speaking people in Kashi appreciating Tamil books and buying them worth thousands of rupees is the biggest strength of cultural connect of our country. I believe the life of the people of Kashi is incomplete without Tamil people and I have become a resident of Kashi. And the life of Tamil people is also incomplete without Kashi. This affinity is easily visible when one comes to Kashi from Tamil Nadu. Being the MP of Kashi, it is a matter of even greater pride for me. There is hardly any boatman in Kashi who does not know 50-100 sentences in Tamil. There is so much interaction there. It is also a good fortune for all of us that a Chair has been established in the name of Subramania Bharati ji in Banaras Hindu University. Subramania Bharati ji had spent a lot of time in Kashi and learned a lot from there. This is also the first time that a gentleman from Tamil Nadu has been made the trustee of the Kashi Vishwanath Trust. The Kashi Vishwanath Temple Trust is very old. This shows the love of Kashi towards Tamil people. All these efforts are going to strengthen the spirit of ‘Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat’. Friends,\\nTamil literature gives us knowledge of the past as well as inspiration for the future. Tamil Nadu’s literature is more than 2000 years old. For example, the Sangam literature revealed that many types of millets, ‘Shree Anna’, were used in ancient Tamil Nadu. Millet fields are mentioned in the ancient Tamil literature 'Agananuru'. The great Tamil poetess Avvaiyar writes about the delicious 'Varagu Arisi Choru' in a beautiful poem. Even today, if someone asks which food Lord Murugan likes as offering, the answer is ‘Thenum Thinai Maavum’. Today, the entire world is connecting with our thousand years old tradition of millets on the initiative of India. I would like that today one of our New Year resolutions should also be related to millets. It should be our resolution that we will restore millets in our diet and also inspire others to do the same. Friends,\\nPerformances of Tamil artistes will take place here in some time from now. It is also a symbol of the rich heritage of our art and culture. It is our duty to showcase it to the whole world. We should also focus on expansion of these art forms with time. The more popular they are among today's young generation, the more they will pass it on to the next generation. Therefore, it is our collective responsibility to tell the youth about this art and teach them. And I am happy that today's event is also becoming a great example of this. Brothers and sisters,\\nDuring the ‘Amrit Kaal’ of independence, it is our responsibility to learn about our Tamil heritage and proudly share it with the country and the world. This heritage is a symbol of our unity and the spirit of 'Nation First'. We have to take Tamil culture, literature, language and tradition forward continuously. With this spirit, I end my speech. Once again, many congratulations to all of you on Puthandu. I also thank Murugan ji for giving me the opportunity to participate in this important occasion. Many best wishes to all of you!\"),\n",

Many congratulations to all of you on the occasion of completion of 60 years i.e. the diamond jubilee of CBI! You have completed the journey of 60 years as the country\\'s premium investigation agency. These six decades have certainly been full of achievements. A compendium of Supreme Court judgments related to CBI cases has also been released here today. It shows the journey of CBI over the years. The new offices of CBI in some cities, Twitter handles and other set-ups which have been launched today will certainly play an important role in further strengthening the CBI. The CBI has given new confidence to the general public through its service and skill. Even today, when someone feels that a case is impossible to solve, they demand that it should be handed over to the CBI. People hold demonstrations demanding the case be taken from the agency which is probing it and hand it over to the CBI. Even if there is any issue at the panchayat level, people say, \"this should be handed over to the CBI.\" CBI is on everyone\\'s lips as a brand of justice. It is no simple feat to win this trust of the common man. All the officers and employees who have contributed in the last 60 years in this organization deserve many congratulations. Many officers have also been honoured with police medals for their excellent service. Many congratulations from my side to those whom I have got the opportunity to honour, those who have received the honour, and their family members.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'English_rendering_of_PM’s_address_at_the.txt', 'Ministry': 'Prime_Ministers_Office', 'Month': 'Apr23html'}, page_content=\"Friends,\\nAt this important stage, along with the achievements of the past, it is equally necessary to brainstorm on the challenges of the future. The purpose of this ‘Chintan Shivir’ (brainstorming session) is to keep yourself upgraded, updated and find ways for the future while learning from past experiences. This is happening at a time when the country has started the journey of ‘Amrit Kaal’. Millions of Indians have resolved to make India developed in the next 25 years. And a developed India is not possible without professional and efficient institutions. And therefore, the CBI has a huge responsibility. Friends,\\nThe CBI has carved a niche for itself as a multi-dimensional and multi-disciplinary investigative agency in the last six decades. Today the scope of CBI has expanded hugely. From bank frauds to crimes related to wildlife, the CBI is looking into cases ranging from organized crime to cybercrime. But the main responsibility of the CBI is to free the country from corruption. Corruption is not an ordinary crime. Corruption deprives the poor of their rights; corruption leads to a series of crimes and gives birth to crimes. Corruption is the biggest obstacle in the way of democracy and justice. Especially, when corruption prevails in the government machinery, it does not allow democracy to flourish. Where there is corruption, the dreams of the youth are the first casualty and the youth do not get proper opportunities. Only a particular ecosystem flourishes there. Corruption is the biggest enemy of talent, and it is from here that nepotism flourishes and keeps on strengthening its grip. When nepotism grows, the strength of the society and the nation dwindles. And when the capability of the nation is low, the development definitely gets affected. Unfortunately, we have inherited a legacy of corruption from the era of slavery. But sadly, instead of removing this legacy, some people kept on empowering it in some form or the other for several decades after independence. Friends,\\nYou recall what was the situation in the country 10 years ago, when you were celebrating the Golden Jubilee? Every decision, every project of the then government was questionable. There was a competition to outdo the previous corruption cases. “If you have done this much corruption, I will do it much bigger” was the common refrain. Today, the term trillion dollars is used for the size of the economy of the country. But this term gained the dubious distinction for the size of the scams at that time. So many major scams happened, but the accused were confident. They knew that the system of the day was with them. And what was its consequence? The country's faith in the system was misplaced. Outrage against corruption was swelling in the whole country. As a result, the entire system started disintegrating, people started avoiding taking decisions and there was an environment of policy paralysis. It stalled the development of the country. Foreign investors were scared. That period of corruption did a lot of damage to India. Friends,\\nOur first responsibility since 2014 was to restore the faith in the system and therefore we started action on mission mode against black money and benami property. Along with the corrupt people, we started attacking the roots which promote corruption. You recall the government tender procedures and government contracts had become contentious. We encouraged transparency in these. Today when we compare the allocation of 2G and 5G spectrum, the difference is clearly visible. You are aware that now GeM i.e. Government e-market place has been set up for purchases in every department of the Central Government. Today every department is making purchases on this digital platform with transparency. Friends,\\nToday we talk about internet banking and record transactions with UPI. But we have also seen the era of phone banking before 2014. This was the time when people associated with influential political parties in Delhi used to get loans worth thousands of crores of rupees on their phone calls. It destroyed the backbone of our economy, our banking system. Over the years, we have worked hard to get our banking sector out of trouble. In that era of phone banking, some people looted 22,000 crore rupees from the country's banks and fled abroad. We enacted the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act. So far, assets worth more than Rs 20,000 crore of these economic criminals who have fled abroad have been confiscated. Friends,\\nThe corrupt had created a novel way to loot the country's treasury, which was going on for decades. This was loot from the beneficiaries of government schemes. During the previous governments, the financial help which was sent to the poor beneficiaries was looted in between. Be it ration, housing, scholarship, pension and in many such government schemes, the real beneficiaries felt cheated. And one Prime Minister had said that out of one rupee, only 15 paise reached the beneficiaries and the rest 85 paise was pilfered. The other day, I was thinking that we have transferred about Rs 27 lakh crore to the poor people through DBT. If one sees in that context, it means that out of 27 lakh crores, about 16 lakh crore rupees would have disappeared. Today, with the trinity of Jan Dhan, Aadhaar, Mobile, every beneficiary is getting his full entitlement. Through this system, more than eight crore fake beneficiaries have been purged of the system. The daughter who was not even born would become a widow and people would continue to draw widow pension. Due to DBT, about 2.25 lakh crore rupees of the country have been prevented from going into the wrong hands. Friends,\\nThere was a time when there was rampant corruption even for clearing the interview round in government jobs. We discontinued the interview rounds in the Group-C, Group-D recruitments of the central government. At one time, there used to be scams in urea too. We also controlled this by coating neem in urea. Scams were also common in defence deals. Defence deals have been sealed with complete transparency in the last nine years. Now we are laying emphasis on making defence equipment in India itself. Friends,\\nYou can also brief me on many such steps regarding the fight against corruption and I can also count them. But we need to learn something from every chapter of the past. Unfortunately, corruption cases drag on for years. There have also been cases, in which even after 10 years of the registration of the FIR, the hearing on the sections of punishment continues. Even today the cases on which action is being taken are many years old. Delay in investigation gives rise to the problem in two ways. On one hand, the corrupt get punished late, while on the other hand the innocent continue to suffer. We have to make sure how we speed up this process and pave the way for the early punishment to those guilty of corruption. We have to study best international practices and focus on the capacity building of the investigating officers. And friends, I want to clarify one more thing to you. Today there is no dearth of political will to take action against corruption in the country. You don't have to hesitate and discontinue (your investigations). I know those against whom you are taking action are very powerful people. For years, they have been a part of the system and the government. It is possible that even today they are part of the government in some states. Over the years, they have also created an ecosystem. This ecosystem often becomes active to cover up their black deeds and to tarnish the image of organizations like yours. It attacks the agency itself. These people will keep distracting you, but you have to remain focused on your work. No corrupt person should be spared. There should be no laxity in our efforts. This is the wish of the country and the countrymen. And I assure you that the country is with you, the law is with you and the constitution of the country is with you. Friends,\\nIt is also very important to eliminate silos between different agencies for better results. Joint and multidisciplinary investigation will be possible only in an environment of mutual trust. Now there is large scale movement of money, people, goods & services beyond the geographical boundaries of the country. As India's economic power is on the rise, the number of those who create obstacles is also increasing. The attacks on the social fabric of India, on our unity and brotherhood, on our economic interests, on our institutions are also increasing day by day. And it obviously involves money earned through corrupt means. Therefore, we also have to understand and study the multinational nature of crime and corruption and reach its root cause. Today we often see that crimes are becoming global due to modern technology. But the same technology and innovation can also provide solutions. We have to further expand the use of forensic science in investigation. Friends,\\nWe must find innovative ways to deal with challenges like cybercrime. We can associate tech enabled entrepreneurs and youngsters with us. In your organisation, there will be many techno-savvy youth who can be put to better use. Friends,\\nI am told that the CBI has compiled 75 such practices which can be abolished. We should work on it in a time bound manner. Over the years, the CBI has evolved itself. This process should continue without any pause and fatigue. I have full faith that this ‘Chintan Shivir’ will give birth to a new self-confidence, create ways to reach new dimensions and bring modernity in the way of solving the most serious and difficult problems. And we will be more effective and result oriented. The common citizen neither wants to do any wrong nor does he like it. We want to move ahead with the trust of those in whose heart truth is alive. And that number is of crores of people. Such a great power is standing with us. Friends, there is no scope for any lapse in our faith. I convey my best wishes to you on the important occasion of this diamond jubilee function. There should be two goals before you while moving forward and that is what you will do for yourself in the next 15 years and what you will achieve by 2047. The next 15 years are very important because it will determine your capability, dedication and resolution when the CBI will complete its 75 years. The country wants to see your rise according to the hopes and expectations of the people when it will celebrate its centenary in 2047. I wish you the very best.\"),\n",

The campaign to provide government jobs to the youth in Madhya Pradesh is going on at a rapid pace. Thousands of youngsters have been recruited to various posts by organizing 'Rozgar Mela' in different districts. Out of these, more than 22,400 youngsters have been recruited as teachers. Today several youngsters have also received appointment letters. I congratulate all the youngsters for getting into such a vital work like teaching. Friends,\\n\\n\\nThe Central Government has implemented the new National Education Policy keeping in view the requirements of modern and developed India. This policy lays emphasis on all round development of children; enriching knowledge & skills, as well as instilling cultural and traditional Indian values in them. Teachers play the most important role in implementing this policy effectively. The massive teacher recruitment campaign in Madhya Pradesh is a major step in this direction. I am told that out of the total new recruitment, almost half of the teachers will be appointed in schools located in tribal areas. With the appointment of such a large number of teachers, the children of rural areas will be benefited the most and our future generations will also be benefited. I am glad that the MP government has set a target of recruiting more than 1 lakh government posts this year. There is also a target of appointing more than 60 thousand teachers by the end of this year. As a result of these efforts, MP has made a huge leap in the quality of education in the National Achievement Survey. In terms of this ranking, the position of MP has reached from number 17 to number 5, i.e. a jump of 12 ranks and that too without any publicity and without spending money on advertisements. They made this achievement silently. It takes dedication to do this kind of work. It is not possible without dedication. In a way, perseverance and devotion are needed towards education. I congratulate the students of Madhya Pradesh, all the teachers of Madhya Pradesh and the MP government for this crucial achievement in the field of education and for this dedication. Friends,\\n\\n\\nIn the 'Azaadi Ka Amritkaal', the country is moving forward with massive goals and new resolutions. The development works being undertaken to achieve these goals are creating new employment opportunities in every sector today. The rapid pace at which the infrastructure development in various sectors is gaining momentum, has also helped in creating new employment opportunities. For example, the Vande Bharat train started between Bhopal and Delhi a few days back. Not only the professionals and businessmen will be benefitted by this train, but the tourism sector will also get a boost. Local products are reaching far and wide through schemes such as ‘One station One product’ and ‘One district One product’. All these schemes are helping in increasing employment opportunities and income. Besides this, Mudra Yojana has been of great help to those people who were very weak financially but wanted to be self-employed. The reforms made by the government at the policy level have also created many new employment opportunities in the startup ecosystem of India. Friends,\\n\\n\\nTo promote employment and self-employment, the government also lays special emphasis on skill development. Under the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana, skill development centres have been opened across the country to provide training to the youth. In this year's budget, an announcement has been made to open 30 Skill India International Centres. In these centres, youth will be trained through New Age Technology. In this year's budget, an initiative has been taken to provide training to small artisans through PM Vishwakarma Yojana and also to connect them with MSMEs. Friends,\\n\\n\\nI want to say one more thing to the thousands of teachers who have been appointed in MP. If you look at your last 10-15 years of life, you will find that the people who have had the greatest influence in your life are definitely your mother and your teachers. Just as they are in your heart, your teachers are in your heart, similarly you too have to make a place in the hearts of your students. You should always keep in mind that your education will not only shape the present but also the future of the country. The education imparted by you will bring a change not only in the students but also in the society. The values you inculcate in your students will create a positive impact not only on today's generation but also on many generations to come. I have complete confidence that you will always be dedicated to the education of children and their overall development. And one thing I always say and believe is 'never let your inner student die'. You may be a teacher but always keep your inner student alert and awaken. It is the student within you who will take you to many new heights of life. Once again, I congratulate all of you; my best wishes to you all!\"),\n",

Many sportspersons from the North East have glorified the Tricolor and won medals for the country. The North East and Manipur have contributed significantly in taking forward the sports tradition of the country. The indigenous games such as Sagol Kangjei, Thang-ta, Yubi Lakpi, Mukna and Hiyang Tannaba are very attractive in their own right. For example, there is a glimpse of Kabaddi in Oolaobi of Manipur. The Hiyang Tannaba reminds one of Kerala's boat races. And Manipur also has a historical association with polo. Just as the North East adds new colours to the country's cultural diversity, it also gives new dimensions to the country's sports diversity. I hope that the sports ministers from all over the country will learn a lot from Manipur. And I am sure the warmth and hospitality of the people of Manipur will make your stay more enjoyable. I welcome and congratulate all the sports ministers and other dignitaries participating in this ‘Chintan Shivir’. Friends,\\nAny ‘Chintan Shivir’ begins with meditation, proceeds with contemplation and ends with implementation. In other words, it starts with reflection, then realization and then implementation and action. So, you have to discuss the future goals and also review the previous conferences in this ‘Chintan Shivir’. You will recall that when we met in Kevadia in 2022, many important issues were discussed. We had agreed to prepare a roadmap keeping in mind the future and create an ecosystem for the betterment of sports. We had talked about increasing the participation between the central government and the states in the sports sector. You must take note of how far we have progressed in Imphal in that direction. And I would also like to tell you that this review should not be done at the level of policies and programs only. Rather, you should review infrastructure development, the sports achievements of the last one year, as well. Friends,\\nIt is true that Indian athletes and sportspersons have performed phenomenally in many international sports events in the last one year. While we celebrate these achievements, we also have to think about how we can help our players even more. In the times to come, the preparations of your ministry and departments will be tested in events such as Squash World Cup, Hockey Asian Champions Trophy, and Asian Youth & Junior Weightlifting Championships etc. The players are preparing at their level, but now our ministries will also have to work with a different approach regarding sports tournaments. Just like there is man to man marking in sports like football and hockey, similarly, all of you will have to do match to match marking. Different strategies have to be made for each tournament. You have to focus on sports infrastructure and sports training according to each tournament. You will also have to decide short term, medium term and long term goals. Friends,\\nGames have one more specialty. A player alone can achieve fitness by practicing continuously, but it is also necessary to play continuously for the best performance. Therefore, it is also necessary that there should be more competitions and sports tournaments at the local level. As a result, players will also get to learn a lot. As the sports ministers, you will have to ensure that no sporting talent is overlooked. Friends,\\nIt is the responsibility of all of us to provide quality sports infrastructure to every talented player of our country. For this, the central government and the state government will have to work together. The Khelo India scheme has definitely improved the sports infrastructure at the district level. But now we have to take this initiative to the block level. The participation of all the stakeholders, including the private sector, is important. There is also an issue with regard to the National Youth Festival. To make it more effective, it requires a new way of thinking. It must be ensured that such programs, which are held in the states, should not become just a formality. When such all-round efforts are made, only then India will be able to establish itself as a leading sports country. Friends,\\nThe ongoing initiatives regarding sports in the North East are also a big inspiration for you. Projects related to sports infrastructure worth more than 400 crore rupees are giving a new direction to the development of the North East today. The National Sports University of Imphal will provide new opportunities to the youth of the country in the near future. The Khelo India Scheme and TOPS have played an important role in this regard. At least two Khelo India Centres in every district of the North East and Khelo India State Centre of Excellence are being set up in every state. These efforts will become the foundation of a new India in the sports world and will give a new identity to the country. You have to speed up such efforts in your respective states as well. I am sure that this ‘Chintan Shivir’ will play an important role in this direction. With this belief, many thanks to all of you! DISCLAIMER: This is the approximate translation of PM’s speech.

With the Delhi Cantt-Ajmer Vande Bharat Express, the commute between Jaipur and Delhi will become easier. This train will also help the tourism industry of Rajasthan a lot. Whether it is Pushkar or Ajmer Sharif, it will be easier for the devotees to reach many such important places of faith. Brothers and sisters,\\nIn the last two months, this is the sixth Vande Bharat Express which I have had the privilege of flagging off. After Mumbai-Solapur Vande Bharat Express, Mumbai-Shirdi Vande Bharat Express, Rani Kamalapati-Hazrat Nizamuddin Vande Bharat Express, Secunderabad-Tirupati Vande Bharat Express, Chennai-Coimbatore Vande Bharat Express, it is now Jaipur-Delhi Vande Bharat Express which is starting today. Ever since the introduction of these modern trains, nearly 60 lakh people have travelled in these trains. The biggest feature of high speed Vande Bharat is that it saves people's time. According to a study, people traveling on one Vande Bharat train save about 2500 hours on each trip. These 2500 hours saved in the journey are becoming available to the people for other works. From manufacturing prowess to guaranteed safety, from high speed to elegant design, Vande Bharat is blessed with many advantages. In the light of all these merits, Vande Bharat train is becoming popular across the country. Vande Bharat has in a way made many new beginnings. Vande Bharat is the first semi-high speed train which is Made in India. Vande Bharat is the first such train which is so compact and efficient. Vande Bharat is the first train to be fitted with the indigenous safety system Kavach. Vande Bharat is the first train in the history of Indian Railways which completed the high climb of Sahyadri Ghats without an additional engine. Vande Bharat Express enriches the spirit of ‘India's First, Always First’! I am happy that the Vande Bharat train has today become synonymous with development, modernity, stability and self-reliance. Today's journey of Vande Bharat will take us towards the journey of developed India tomorrow. I congratulate the people of Rajasthan for the Vande Bharat train. Friends,\\nIt is the misfortune of our country that an important system like Railways, which is such an important part in the life of a common man, was also made an arena of politics. India had got a large railway network after independence. But the modernization of Railways has always been dominated by political interests. Political interest weighed heavily on the choice of the person becoming the railway minister. The decision to run trains from stations was also politically motivated. New trains used to be announced in the budget due to political considerations, but they never ran. The situation was such that there was politics in railway recruitments and corruption was rampant. The situation was such that the land of the poor people was grabbed in the garb of jobs in the railways. Thousands of unmanned level crossings in the country were also left unattended. Everything was ignored from railway safety to railway cleanliness and railway platform cleanliness. The situation changed for the better only after 2014. When the people of the country formed a stable government with full majority, when the pressure of political bargaining was eased out from the government, then the Railways also heaved a sigh of relief and chugged to achieve new heights. Today, every Indian is proud to see the transformation of the Indian Railways. Brothers and sisters,\\nThe people of Rajasthan have always showered us with their bountiful blessings. Today, our government is making this land of heroes a land of new possibilities and new opportunities. Rajasthan is one of the top tourist destinations in the country. It is very important that the time of the tourists visiting Rajasthan is saved and they get maximum facilities. Connectivity plays an important role in this regard. It has to be admitted that the initiatives of the Central Government regarding the connectivity in Rajasthan in the last few years have been unprecedented. In February itself, I got the opportunity to visit Dausa for the inauguration of the Delhi-Dausa-Lalsot section of Delhi-Mumbai Expressway. Apart from Dausa, this expressway will greatly benefit the people of Alwar, Bharatpur, Sawai Madhopur, Tonk, Bundi and Kota districts. The Central Government is also working on about 1400 km of roads in the border areas of Rajasthan. At present, there is a proposal to construct about 1,000 kilometers of more roads in Rajasthan. Friends,\\nOur government is according top priority to road as well as rail connectivity in Rajasthan. Work has already begun on the construction of a new railway line from Taranga Hill to Abu Road via Ambaji. The demand for this rail line is more than 100 years old, which is now being fulfilled by the BJP government. We have also completed the work of converting the rail line between Udaipur to Ahmedabad into broad gauge. As a result, the Mewar region has been connected to Gujarat and other parts of the country by broad gauge. Electrification of about 75 percent of Rajasthan's network has been completed in the last nine years. Ashwini ji just explained in detail that there has been an increase of more than 14 times in the rail budget of Rajasthan compared to what it was before 2014. There has been a 14 times increase in the budget between then and now. Before 2014, where the average railway budget for Rajasthan was around 700 crore rupees, it is more than 9500 crore rupees this year. During this period, the doubling of railway lines has also more than doubled. The work of gauge conversion and doubling of railways done in the past years has greatly benefited the tribal areas of Rajasthan. Rail facilities have expanded in Dungarpur, Udaipur, Chittorgarh, Pali and Sirohi districts. Along with the railway lines, the railway stations of Rajasthan are also being transformed. Dozens of railway stations in Rajasthan are being developed under the Amrit Bharat Station Scheme. Friends,\\nKeeping in mind the convenience of the tourists, the government is also running different types of circuit trains. Bharat Gaurav Circuit train has made more than 70 trips so far. More than 15,000 passengers have travelled in these trains. Bharat Gaurav Circuit trains are being run today for many such places, be it Ayodhya-Kashi, the pilgrimage centres in South, Dwarka ji, or the pilgrimage sites of the Gurus of the Sikh community. We often see the positive feedback from these passengers and the appreciation for these trains on social media. These trains are also strengthening the spirit of ‘Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat’. Friends,\\nOver the years, Indian Railways has made another effort which has also helped in making the local products of Rajasthan available across the country. This is ‘One Station One Product’ campaign. Indian Railways has set up around 70 ‘One Station One Product’ stalls in Rajasthan. Jaipuri quilts, Sanganeri block print bed sheets, products made of rose and other handicrafts are being sold in these stalls. That is, the small farmers, artisans and handicrafts of Rajasthan have got this new medium to access the market. This is everyone's participation in development, that is, everyone's effort for development. When the infrastructure of connectivity like rail is strengthened, then the country becomes strong. This benefits the common citizen, the poor and middle class of the country. I am sure that the modern Vande Bharat train will play an important role in speeding up the development of Rajasthan. And I especially express my gratitude to Gehlot ji that these days he is going through many political crises.\"),\n",

Today is the hundredth episode of 'Mann Ki Baat'. I have received thousands of letters from all of you, lakhs of messages … and I have tried to read as many letters as possible, have a look at them and try to understand the messages a bit. Many a time while reading your letters, I got emotional, was filled with emotions, got carried away in emotions and then also composed myself. You have congratulated me on the 100th episode of 'Mann Ki Baat', but I say this from the core of my heart,…that in fact, all of you, the listeners of 'Mann Ki Baat', our countrymen, deserve congratulations. 'Mann Ki Baat' is the 'Mann Ki Baat' of crores of Indians, it is the expression of their feelings. Friends, the 3rd of October, 2014 was the festival of Vijaya Dashami and all of us together started the journey of 'Mann Ki Baat' on the day of Vijaya Dashami. Vijaya Dashami is the festival of victory of good over evil. 'Mann Ki Baat' has also become a unique festival of goodness and positivity of the countrymen. A festival that comes every month, keenly awaited by all of us. We celebrate positivity in this. We also celebrate people's participation in this. Sometimes it is hard to believe that so many months, so many years have passed since 'Mann Ki Baat' commenced. Every episode was special in itself. Every time, the novelty of new examples, every time the extension of new successes of the countrymen. In 'Mann Ki Baat', people from every corner of the country, people of all age groups joined. Whether it is about Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, or the Swachh Bharat movement, love for Khadi or nature, whether it is the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav or Amrit Sarovar, any subject with which 'Mann Ki Baat' got associated, turned into a mass movement, and you people have made it so. When I jointly shared 'Mann Ki Baat' with the then US President Barack Obama, it was discussed all over the world. Friends, for me, 'Mann Ki Baat' has been like worshipping the qualities in others. I had a guide - Shri Laxmanrao ji Inamdar. We used to address him as Vakeel Saheb. He always used to say that we should worship the qualities of others. No matter who is face to face with you, be it your compatriot, be it your opponent, we should try to know about their good qualities and learn from them. This trait of his has always inspired me. 'Mann Ki Baat' has become a great medium to learn from the qualities of others. My dear countrymen, this program has never let me be away from you. I remember, when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, it was natural to meet and interact with the common people there. The work and tenure of the Chief Minister is like that…, there are many opportunities to come together. But after coming to Delhi in 2014, I found that life here was very different. The nature of the work is different, the responsibility is different, one is bound by circumstances, the rigours of security & time limits. In the initial days, something felt different, there was an emptiness. Fifty years ago, I did not leave my home just to find one day it would be difficult to contact the people of my own country. The very countrymen who are my everything,… I could not live separated from them. 'Mann Ki Baat' gave me a solution to this challenge, a way to connect with the common man. The post and protocol remained limited to the system and public sentiment, along with crores of people, became an inseparable part of my inner world. Every month I read thousands of messages from the people of the country, every month I get to view one or the other wonderful manifestation of the countrymen. I see and feel the extremities of the penance and sacrifice of the countrymen. I just don't feel that I am even a little far from you. For me 'Mann Ki Baat' is not a program, for me it is a matter of faith, of worship, or Vrat. Like when people go to worship God, they bring along a Thaal of Prasad. For me, 'Mann Ki Baat' is like a Thaal of Prasad at the feet of God in the form of Janata-Janardan, the people. 'Mann Ki Baat' has become a spiritual journey of my being. 'Mann Ki Baat' is a journey from the self to the collective. 'Mann Ki Baat' is a journey from myself to ourselves. It is not me, but you are its Sanskar Sadhana. Imagine, some of our countrymen have been planting trees on deserted hills and barren land for 40 odd \\xa0years, many people have been digging stepwells and ponds for water conservation for 30 odd years, cleaning them as well. Some have been teaching underprivileged children for 25-30 years, some are helping in the treatment of the poor. I have become emotional while mentioning them many a time in 'Mann Ki Baat'. Friends from AIR had to re-record it many times. Today, a lot from the past is coming in front of my eyes. These efforts of the countrymen have inspired me to continuously keep striving. Friends, the people who we mention in 'Mann Ki Baat' are all our Heroes who have made this program come alive. Today, when we have reached the milestone of the 100th episode, I also wish that we once again go to all these Heroes to know about their journey. Today, we will also try to talk to some colleagues. Brother Sunil Jaglan of Haryana is joining me. Sunil Jaglan ji has had such an impact on my mind because there used to be a lot of discussion on Gender Ratio in Haryana and I also started the campaign of 'Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao' from Haryana itself. And meanwhile, when I came across Sunil ji's 'Selfie With Daughter' campaign, I felt very happy. I also learned from him and included it in 'Mann Ki Baat'. In no time 'Selfie With Daughter' turned into a Global Campaign. And the issue in this was neither selfie, nor technology,… importance was accorded to the daughter. The importance of a daughter in life also comes to the fore through this campaign. The result of many such efforts is that today the Gender Ratio has improved in Haryana. Let's chat with Sunil ji today.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'English_rendering_of_PM’s_address_in_the.txt', 'Ministry': 'Prime_Ministers_Office', 'Month': 'Apr23html'}, page_content=\"Mr. Prime Minister - Namaskar Sunil ji,\\n\\nSunil- Namaskar sir, my joy has risen a lot after hearing your voice sir. Prime Minister- Sunil ji everyone remembers 'Selfie with daughter'... Now when it is being discussed once again, how do you feel? Sunil - Prime Minister, in fact, the fourth battle of Panipat that you started from our state Haryana to bring smiles on the faces of the daughters, which the whole country has tried to win under your leadership, is really important for me, for every daughter’s father and those who love daughters. Prime Minister- Sunil ji, how is your daughter now, what is she doing these days? Sunil- Yes, my daughters are Nandani and Yachika, one is studying in\\xa0 class 7, one is studying in class 4 and they are big fans of yours. Actually they and their classmates have written letters to you saying Thank you Prime Minister. Prime Minister – That’s great! Give lots of blessings to the daughters on my behalf and that of listeners of Mann Ki Baat. Sunil- Thank you very much. Because of you, smiles on the faces of the daughters of the country are continuously on the rise. Prime Minister - Thank you very much Sunil ji. Sunil – Ji. Thank you. It’s a matter of fulfilment for me that in 'Mann Ki Baat' we have mentioned hundreds of inspiring stories of woman power of the country. Be it our army or the sports world, whenever I have talked about the achievements of women, it has been praised a lot. Like we discussed about the women of Deur village of Chhattisgarh. These women, through self-help groups, run campaigns to clean village squares, roads and temples. Similarly, the country also took a lot of inspiration from the tribal women of Tamil Nadu, who exported thousands of Eco-Friendly Terracotta Cups. In Tamil Nadu itself, 20 thousand women came together to revive the Nag river in Vellore. Many such campaigns have been led by our woman power and 'Mann Ki Baat' has served as a platform to bring their efforts to the fore. Friends, we now have one more gentleman on the phone line. His name is Manzoor Ahmed. In 'Mann Ki Baat', Manzoor Ahmed ji was referred to while talking about Pencil Slates of Jammu and Kashmir. Prime Minister – Manzoor ji, how are you? Manzoor ji - Thank you sir... doing very well sir. Prime Minister- It is a great pleasure to talk to you in this 100th episode of Mann Ki Baat. Manzoor ji - Thank you sir. Prime Minister- Well, how is the pencil-slates work going on? Manzoor ji - It is going very well sir. Ever since you mentioned our Man Ki Baat in Mann ki Baat programme, sir, work has increased a lot since then sir and employment for others has also increased a lot in this work. Prime Minister- How many people would be getting employment now? Manzoor ji - Now I have 200 plus... Prime Minister - Great! I am very happy. Manzoor ji – Ji sir..ji sir…now I am expanding it in a couple of months and employment for 200 people will increase sir. Prime Minister – Well great! See Manzoor ji... Manjoor ji -\\xa0 Yes sir... Prime Minister- I remember very well and on that day you told me that this is such a work which has no identity, there is no self-recognition, and you underwent a lot of distress and because of this you had to face a lot of difficulties. But now there is recognition and you are giving employment to more than 200 people. Manjoor ji -\\xa0 Yes sir... Prime Minister- And you have given us delightful news of carrying out new expansions and giving employment to further 200 people. Manzoor ji- Even sir, the farmers who are here, sir, also got a lot of benefit from this, sir. Used to sell a tree for 2000, now the same tree has reached 5000 sir. Demand has increased a lot in this since then... and it has also gained its own identity. Sir, I have many orders for this, now I am going to expand further in one or two months and cover two to four villages, taking 200 to 250 boys and girls who can be adjusted in this and they can carry on with their livelihood sir. Prime Minister- See Manzoor ji, how tremendous the power of Vocal for Local is.., you have manifested it on the ground. Manjoor ji -\\xa0 Yes sir. Prime Minister- Many many good wishes to you and all the farmers of the village and also to all the colleagues working with you, thank you brother. Manzoor ji - Thank you sir. Friends, there are so many talented people in our country who have reached the pinnacle of success through their hard work. I remember, Venkat Murali Prasad ji of Visakhapatnam did an Atmanirbhar Bharat Chart Share. He had told us how he would make maximum use of Indian products only. When Pramod ji of Bettiah set up a small unit to make LED bulbs or Santosh ji of Garhmukteshwar started making mats, 'Mann Ki Baat' became the medium to bring their products in front of everyone. We have discussed many examples from Make in India to Space Start-ups in 'Mann Ki Baat'. Friends, you may remember that a few episodes ago I had also mentioned about Manipur's sister Vijayashanti Devi. Vijayashanti ji makes clothes from lotus fibers. This unique eco-friendly idea of her was discussed in 'Mann Ki Baat' and her work became more popular. Today Vijayashanti ji is with us on the phone. Prime Minister :- Namaste Vijayashanti ji! How are you? Vijayashanti ji :- Sir, I am fine. Prime Minister :- and how's your work going on? Vijayashanti ji :- sir, still working along with my 30 women\\n\\nPrime Minister :- in such a short period you have reached 30 persons team! Vijayashanti ji :- Yes sir, this year also more expand with 100 women in my area\\n\\nPrime Minister :- So your target is 100 women\\n\\nVijayashanti ji :- Yaa! 100 women\\n\\nPrime Minister :- and now people are familiar with this lotus stem fiber\\nVijayashanti ji :- yes sir, everyone's know from 'Mann Ki Baat' Program all over India. Prime Minister :- so now its very popular\\n\\nVijayashanti ji :- yes sir, from Prime Minister 'Mann ki Baat' program everyone knows about lotus fiber\\n\\nPrime Minister :- So now you got the market also? Vijayashanti ji :- Yes, I have got a market from USA also they want to buy in bulk in lots quantities, but I want to give from this year to send the U.S also. Prime Minister :- So, now you are an exporter? Vijayashanti ji :- yes sir, from this year I export our product made in India Lotus fiber\\n\\nPrime Minister :- so, when I say Vocal for Local and now Local for Global\\n\\nVijayashanti ji :- yes sir, I want to reach my product all over the globe of all world\\n\\nPrime Minister :- so congratulations and wish you best luck\\n\\nVijayashanti ji :- Thank you sir\\n\\nPrime Minister :- Thank you, Thank you Vijayashanti\\n\\nVijayashanti ji :- Thank you sir\\n\\nFriends, there has been another specialty of 'Mann Ki Baat'. Through 'Mann Ki Baat', many mass movements have come into being and gained momentum.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'English_rendering_of_PM’s_address_in_the.txt', 'Ministry': 'Prime_Ministers_Office', 'Month': 'Apr23html'}, page_content=\"For example, the very mission to re-establish our toys and our toy industry started with 'Mann Ki Baat'. The beginning of raising awareness about Indian breed dogs, our native dogs, was also started with 'Mann Ki Baat' only. We had started another campaign that we will not bargain with the poor small scale shopkeepers,… we will not haggle with them. Even when the 'Har Ghar Tiranga' campaign started, 'Mann Ki Baat' played a big role in connecting the countrymen with this resolve. Every such example has become an agent of change in the society. Pradeep Sangwan ji too has taken up such a task to inspire the society. In 'Mann Ki Baat', we discussed Pradeep Sangwan ji's 'Healing Himalayas' campaign. He is with us on the phone line. Modi ji – Pradeep ji Namaskar! Pradeep ji - Sir Jai Hind! Modi ji - Jai Hind, Jai Hind, brother! How are you? Pradeep ji - Very nice sir. Even better on hearing your voice. Modi ji - You thought of healing the Himalayas. Pradeep ji - Yes sir. Modi ji - Also launched a campaign. How is your campaign going on these days? Pradeep ji - Sir it is going on very well. From 2020, imagine that the amount work we used to do in five years is now done in one year. Modi ji – That’s great! Pradeep ji - Yes, yes, sir. In the beginning, I was very nervous, I was very scared that whether I would be able to do this for the rest of my life or not, but got some support and till 2020, we were struggling a lot honestly. Not many people were joining …, there were many people who were not able to support. They were not even paying that much attention to our campaign. But after 2020, when it was mentioned in 'Mann Ki Baat', many things changed. Meaning, earlier we used to do 6-7 cleaning drives in a year, or 10 cleaning drives. Today, we collect five tons of garbage on a daily basis from different locations. Modi ji - Wonderful! Pradeep ji - After being mentioned in 'Mann Ki Baat', believe me Sir, that I was at the stage of almost giving up at that point of time and after that a lot of change came in my life and then speeded up so fast which was beyond our comprehension. So I'm really thankful how you find out people like us. Who works in such a remote area, we are working sitting in the Himalayan region. We are working at this altitude. You found us there. You brought our work in front of the world. So it was a very emotional moment for me even then and even today that I am able to talk to the Principal Servant of our country. Nothing can be more fortunate for me than this. Modi ji – Pradeep ji! You are doing sadhna in true sense on the peaks of the Himalayas and I am sure now on hearing your name, people remember how you are involved in the cleanliness campaign of the mountains. Pradeep ji - Yes sir. Modi ji – And as you told us now a huge team is being formed and you are doing such a huge amount of work daily. Pradeep ji - Yes sir. Modi ji – And I have full faith that through your efforts and discussion about it, now many mountaineers have started posting photos related to cleanliness. Pradeep ji - Yes sir! A lot. Modi ji – It is good. Through the efforts of friends like you, waste is also a wealth is now becoming stable in the minds of the people, and the environment is also being protected now and the Himalayas which we are proud of, are being taken care of and conserved… the common man is also connecting. Pradeep ji I liked it very much. Thank you very much brother. Pradeep ji - Thank you Sir Thank you so much Jai Hind\\n\\nFriends, Today tourism is growing very fast in the country. Be it our natural resources, be it rivers, mountains, ponds or our pilgrimage sites, it is very important to keep them clean. This will help the tourism industry a lot. Along with cleanliness in tourism, we have also discussed the Incredible India movement often. Through this movement, for the first time, people came to know about such places, which were just in their neighbourhood. I always say that before going abroad for tourism, we must visit at least 15 tourist destinations of our country and these destinations should not be from the state where you reside…they \\xa0must be from any other state outside your state. Similarly, we have continuously talked about serious topics like clean Siachen, single use plastic and e-waste. Today, this effort of 'Mann Ki Baat' is very important in solving environmental issues about which the whole world is concerned. Friends, this time I have received another special message from UNESCO DG Audrey Azoulay regarding 'Mann Ki Baat'. She has given best wishes to all the countrymen for this wonderful journey of 100 episodes. Also, she has asked some questions too. Let us first listen to the Mann Ki Baat of the DG of UNESCO. #Audio (UNESCO DG)#\\nDG UNESCO: Namaste Excellency, Dear Prime Minister on behalf of UNESCO I thank you for this opportunity to be part of the 100th episode of the ‘Mann Ki Baat’ Radio broadcast. UNESCO and India have a long common history. We have very strong partnerships together in all areas of our mandate - education, science, culture and information and I would like to take this opportunity today to talk about the importance of education. UNESCO is working with its member states to ensure that everyone in the world has access to quality education by 2030. With the largest population in the world, could you please explain Indian way to achieving this objective. UNESCO also works to support culture and protect heritage and India is chairing the G-20 this year. World leaders would be coming to Delhi for this event. Excellency, how does India want to put culture and education at the top of the international agenda? I once again thank you for this opportunity and convey my very best wishes through you to the people of India....see you soon. Thank you very much. Thank you Excellency. I am happy to interact with you in the 100th 'Mann Ki Baat' programme. I am also happy that you have raised the important issues of education and culture. Friends, The DG of UNESCO has wanted to know about India's efforts regarding Education and Cultural Preservation. Both these topics have been favorite topics of 'Mann Ki Baat'. Whether it is about education or culture, whether it is about its preservation or promotion, this has been an ancient tradition of India. The work that the country is doing in this direction today is really commendable. Be it the National Education Policy or the option of studying in a regional language, or technology integration in education, you will notice many such efforts. Years ago, programs like 'Gunotsav and Shala Praveshotsav' had become a wonderful example of public participation in Gujarat to providing better education and reducing dropout rates. In 'Mann Ki Baat', we have highlighted the efforts of many such people, who are selflessly working for education. You may remember, once we discussed about Late D. Prakash Rao, a tea vendor in Odisha who was engaged in the mission of teaching poor children. Be it Sanjay Kashyap, who runs Digital Libraries in the villages of Jharkhand, Hemlata N.K., who helped many children through e-learning during Covid. Yes, we have referred to examples of many such teachers in 'Mann Ki Baat'. We have also accorded regular place to the efforts of Cultural Preservation in 'Mann Ki Baat'. Be it Lakshdweep's Kummel Brothers Challengers Club, or platforms such as Karnataka's 'Kwemshree' ji's 'Kala Chetna', people from every corner of the country have sent me such examples through letters. We had also talked about the three competitions which were related to songs, lullabies and 'Rangoli' on patriotism. You must remember, once we had discussed Indian forms of education through Story Telling with Story Tellers from across the country. I have an unwavering belief that the biggest change can be brought about by collective effort. This year, where we are moving forward in the Azadi Ka Amritkaal, we are also presiding over the G-20. This is also one of the reasons why our resolve to enrich Diverse Global Cultures along with education has become stronger. My dear countrymen, a mantra from our Upanishads has been inspiring our collective thought for centuries. Charaiveti Charaiveti Charaiveti |\\n\\nKeep moving - keep moving - keep moving\\n\\nToday we are completing the 100th episode of 'Mann Ki Baat' with the same spirit of Charaiveti Charaiveti. In strengthening the social fabric of India, 'Mann Ki Baat' is like the thread of a rosary, holding each bead together. In every episode, the spirit of service and capability of the countrymen have inspired others. In this program, every countryman becomes an inspiration to other countrymen. In a way, every episode of Mann Ki Baat prepares the ground for the next episode. 'Mann Ki Baat' has always moved ahead with goodwill, the spirit of service-spirit and the sense of duty. This positivity will take the country forward in the Azadi Ka Amritkaal…, will take her to a new heights and I am happy that the beginning made by 'Mann Ki Baat' is becoming a new tradition in the country today. A tradition in which we see the spirit of everyone's effort. Friends, today I would also like to thank the personnel of All India Radio who record this entire program with great patience. I am also thankful to the translators, who translate 'Mann Ki Baat' into different regional languages really fast in a very short time. I also thank the personnel of Doordarshan and MyGov. I express my gratitude to all the TV channels, people from electronic media across the country, who show 'Mann Ki Baat' without commercial breaks and lastly, I would also like to express my gratitude to those who don the mantle of 'Mann Ki Baat' - the people of India, people who have faith in India. All this has been possible only because of your inspiration and strength. Friends, by the way, I have so much to say today that both time and words are falling short. But I am sure that you all will understand my expressions, understand my feelings. As a member of your family, I have been in your midst with the help of 'Mann Ki Baat', will remain in your midst. We will meet again next month. We will again celebrate the successes of the countrymen with new topics and new information, till then I take leave of you. Take good care of yourself and your loved ones. Thank you very much, Namaskar! ***\\nDS/TS/VK\\n\"),\n",

It is a privilege for me that I am able to meet old time friends. Let's see who gets the opportunity to talk first. Prime Minister: What is your name? Beneficiary: Solanki Bharatbhai Bachuji\\nPrime Minister: Were you the first one to come when we started 'SWAGAT'? Beneficiary Bharatbhai: Yes Sir, I was among the first to come. Prime Minister: So how did you become so aware and how did you come to know that if you have to say something to the government officials, you have to go to 'SWAGAT'? Beneficiary Bharatbhai: Yes Sir, it is like that I had received the work order of the Government Housing Scheme on 20-11-2000 for a week from Dahegam Tehsil. But I did the construction work of the house till the plinth and after that I had no experience whether to build a wall of 9 inches or 14 inches. During that time, an earthquake struck. So I was a bit apprehensive whether the house that I was building would survive with a wall of 9 inches or not. Then I myself made a wall of 14 inches instead of 9 inches with hard work. But when I asked for my labour charges for the second week, the block development officer told me that I would not be paid for the second week as I had made a wall of 14 inches instead of 9 inches. He also told me to deposit Rs. 8,253 which I got for the first week along with interest to the block office. I went to the district and block offices several times with my complaint, but I did not get any hearing. When I went to Gandhinagar district, one of the officials there asked me why I was making rounds of the office every day. I told him about my problem. I made a wall of 14 inches instead of 9 inches and I was not being paid for my work for a week. I also told him that I did not own any house and was living with my family. I informed him that I was making rounds of offices because I was up against several problems. So that official told me ‘Kaka, you do one thing. You go to the secretariat of Hon’ble Shri Narendrabhai Modi where SWAGAT is held every month on Thursday’. So, Sir, I reached the secretariat and I made my complaint directly to you. You listened to me very patiently and replied calmly. I started getting my dues for building the wall of 14 inches instead of 9 inches after you ordered the concerned official. Today I live happily in my own house with my family of six children.\"),\n",

Do all the children in the family study or what do they do? Bharatbhai: Sir, my four daughters are married and the remaining two daughters are yet to be married. They are not even 18 years old. Prime Minister: But your house is still intact or it has become very old in 20 years? Bharatbhai: Sir, earlier rain water used to drip from the roof. There was also the problem of water. The roof has become weak since it is not a cemented one. Prime Minister: Are your sons-in-law good? Bharatbhai: Sir, all of them are very good. Prime Minister: Okay, be happy. But did you tell others about the SWAGAT program or send other people there or not? Bharatbhai: Sir, I used to send others also to this program. I would often tell them that Chief Minister Narendrabhai Modi gave me a satisfactory answer and listened to me patiently and did my work to my satisfaction. So, if you have any problem, you can go to the SWAGAT program. And if you have any problem, I will accompany you and show you the office. Prime Minister: Okay, Bharatbhai. I am happy.

Vinaybhai: Namaskar, Sir. Prime Minister: How are you? Vinaybhai: Sir, I am fine with your blessings. Prime Minister: Do you know that now we call people like you ‘Divyang’? People must also be using the same word for you with respect in your village. Vinaybhai: Yes Sir. Prime Minister: I vividly remember that you fought so hard for your rights at that time. Tell everyone what your fight was at that time and that you went even to the Chief Minister and earned your rights. Explain that to everyone. Vinaybhai: Sir, the issue at that time for me was to become self-sufficient. At that time, I had applied for the loan in the Minority Finance Commission. My application was approved but I did not get the cheque on time. I was very upset. Then one of my friends told me that I would get a solution to my problems in the SWAGAT program which is held in Gandhinagar. He told me that I would have to raise my problem there. So Sir, I came to Gandhinagar in a bus from Waghmera village of Tapi district, and took advantage of your program. You heard my problem and immediately ensured a cheque of Rs. 39,245. With that money, I opened a general store in my house in 2008. I continue to run my household expenses with that store. Sir, I married within two years of the opening of my store. I have two daughters and they are studying today. The elder daughter is in 8th class and the younger one is in 6th class. And the family is self-sufficient today. And for the last two years, I have been farming along with my wife besides running the store. Today I am earning a good income. Prime Minister: Vinaybhai, what do you sell in the store? Vinaybhai: We sell all food grains and grocery items. Prime Minister: When we emphasise Vocal for Local, do the people come to your store to buy Vocal for Local products? Vijaybhai: Yes Sir, they come to purchase grains, pulses, rice, sugar etc. Prime Minister: Now we are running the 'Shree Anna' campaign. Everybody should consume millets, jowar etc. Is Shree Anna sold in your store or not? Vinaybhai: Yes Sir. Prime Minister: Do you give employment to others or do you yourself work with your wife? Vinaybhai: We employ labourers. Prime Minister: Ok. You have to use the services of labourers. How many people have got employment because of you? Vinaybhai:\\xa0 About 4-5 people have got employment to work in the fields. Prime Minister: Now we urge everyone to make digital payments. Do you make digital payments there? Do you make digital transactions through mobile phones or asking for QR code etc.? Vinaybhai: Yes Sir, many people come to my shop, they ask for my QR code and put money in my account. Prime Minister: It is good. That means everything is available in your village. Vinaybhai: Yes Sir. Every facility is there. Prime Minister: Vinaybhai, your specialty is that you have made the 'SWAGAT' program successful and others must be asking you about the benefits you got from the 'SWAGAT' programme. You showed so much courage that you reached the Chief Minister. Did the officers harass you when they came to know that you made a complaint against them? Vinaybhai: Yes Sir. Prime Minister: Was everything sorted out after that? Vinaybhai: Yes Sir. Prime Minister: Now Vinaybhai must be boasting in the village that he has a direct connection with the Chief Minister. You don't do that. Do you? Vinaybhai: No Sir. Prime Minister: Ok, Vinaybhai. Many many congratulations to you. You have done a good job of educating your daughters. Give them a good education, Ok. Prime Minister: What is your name? Rakeshbhai Parekh: Rakeshbhai Parekh. Prime Minister: Rakeshbhai Parekh, Have you come from Surat district? Rakeshbhai Parekh: Yes, I have come from Surat. Prime Minister: Do you live in Surat or somewhere around Surat? Rakeshbhai Parekh: I live in an apartment in Surat. Prime Minister: Yes, tell me about your experience. Rakeshbhai Parekh: Due to a rail project in 2006, our building was demolished. It was an 8-storey building, which consisted of 32 flats and 8 shops. It had become dilapidated; because of this the building was to be demolished. We were not getting permission for it. We went to the Corporation, but it did not give us permission. We all gathered for a meeting and then we came to know that Narendra Modi Sahib was the Chief Minister at that time. I lodged the complaint. I met Mr. Gambit at that time. He told me that my complaint had been received and I would be called as soon as possible. He said that he was upset that I did not have a home. He called me the next day. I got an opportunity to meet you in the SWAGAT program. At that time, you gave me approval. I used to live in a rented house. I lived in a rented house for 10 years. We then got the approval. We got the whole building built from scratch. You cited it as a special case and gave approval immediately. We called a meeting of all the residents and built the building with the involvement of everybody. We started living in the same building again. All the 32 families and 8 shopkeepers are expressing their gratitude to you. Prime Minister: Parekhji, you have really done well not only to yourself, but to 32 families as well. And today 32 families are living happily. How are these 32 families? Are they all happy? Rakeshbhai Parekh: Everyone is happy, but I am in a little trouble, Sir. Prime Minister: Everyone lives together? Rakeshbhai Parekh: Yes, everyone lives together. Prime Minister: And you are in trouble again? Rakeshbhai Parekh: Yes Sir, you said at that time that I could stay in your bungalow if I had any problem. You said that I could stay in your bungalow till the building was made. But I stayed in a rented out till the building was finally built. Now I live peacefully in the house with my family. I have two sons. I live peacefully with my wife and sons. Prime Minister: What are your sons doing? Rakeshbhai Parekh: One son is doing a job and the other one is into cooking. It is called hotel management. He is basically running the house. I am in pain due to a pinched nerve and I can’t move. I have been suffering for the last one and a half years. Prime Minister: But do you do yoga etc. or not? Rakeshbhai Parekh: Yes Sir, exercise etc. is going on. Prime Minister: You should take the advice of the doctor before hurrying for the operation. Now there is an Ayushman card also. Have you made the Ayushman card? It can take care of the expenditure of up to five lakh rupees. And the Gujarat government also has several schemes like the MAA Card scheme. Take advantage of them and get rid of the problem once and for all. Rakeshbhai Parekh: Yes, Sir. Prime Minister: You are not old enough to get tired like this. Prime Minister: Well Rakeshbhai, you have helped many people through SWAGAT. You are an example of how a conscious citizen can help others. I am also happy that the government took you and your words seriously. The issue which was resolved years ago, now your children are also getting settled. Convey my best wishes to everyone. Friends,\\nAfter this exchange, I am satisfied that the purpose with which we started the SWAGAT program is largely successful. People are not only getting a solution to their problems through this program, but people like Rakesh ji are raising the issue of hundreds of families along with themselves. I believe that the behaviour of the government should be such that the common man can share his views with it, consider it a friend and move ahead. I am happy that Bhupendrabhai is also with us today. I can also see that there are some ministers and officers in the districts. Now there are many new faces.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'English_rendering_of_PM’s_interaction_an.txt', 'Ministry': 'Prime_Ministers_Office', 'Month': 'Apr23html'}, page_content=\"I know very few people. 'SWAGAT', dedicated to the service of crores of citizens of Gujarat, is completing 20 years. And I just got a chance to listen to old experiences from some beneficiaries and refresh old memories. The relentless efforts and loyalty of many people are behind the success of SWAGAT. On this occasion, I thank all those people and congratulate them. Friends,\\nWhen any system is born or it is prepared, there is a vision and intention behind it. How far that system will reach in the future, its destiny, the end result, is decided by that intention. When I launched 'SWAGAT' in 2003, it had not been long since I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat. Prior to that, my life was spent as a worker, living among ordinary human beings. After becoming the Chief Minister, people usually say that once you get the Chair, then everything changes, people also change. I used to hear this. But I had made up my mind that I would continue to be the same as people made me. What I have learned from them, the experiences that I have gained from them, I will not be a slave to the compulsions of the Chair under any circumstances. I will live among the people and work for the people. With this determination, StateWide Attention on Grievances by Application of Technology, i.e. 'SWAGAT' was born. The spirit behind SWAGAT was – Welcome common man in democratic institutions! The spirit behind SWAGAT was – welcome the legislation, welcome the solution! And, today even after 20 years, the meaning of SWAGAT is- Ease of living, reach of governance! As a result of sincere efforts, this Gujarat model of governance has become an identity of its own in the whole world. Firstly, the International Telecom Organization called it an excellent example of e-transparency and e-accountability. Then the United Nations also praised the SWAGAT. It also received the prestigious Public Service Award of the UN. In 2011, when the Congress government was in power at the Centre, Gujarat also won the Government of India's Gold Award in e-governance thanks to SWAGAT. And this process is going on continuously. Brothers and sisters,\\nFor me, the biggest award for the success of SWAGAT is that through this we were able to serve the people of Gujarat. We prepared a practical system through SWAGAT. Arrangements were made for public hearing at block and tehsil levels. After that the responsibility was given to the District Magistrate at the district level. And, at the state level, I myself took this responsibility. And I also benefited a lot from this. When I used to hold direct public hearings, I started getting feedback very easily whether people at the lowest strata were benefiting from the government or not, whether the benefits were reaching them or not, whether they were not facing any problem due to the policies of the government, whether they are not upset because of the intention of some local government official, whether somebody is not snatching what he is entitled to etc. And the power and reputation of SWAGAT increased so much that even an ordinary citizen of Gujarat could go to the senior officer. And if he was not heard or his work was not done, he would say: ‘If you don’t hear me, I will go to SWAGAT’. As soon as he would say that he would go to SWAGAT, the officers would stand up immediately and hear his complaint. SWAGAT had gained such a reputation. I used to get direct information about the complaints, problems and difficulties of the common people. And importantly, I would get a lot of satisfaction by solving their problems. And it did not stop here. The SWAGAT program used to be held once a month but the work had to be done throughout the month because hundreds of complaints used to come and I used to analyse it. Is there any department against which complaints are coming again and again, is there any officer against whom complaints are coming again and again or is there any area which is full of complaints? Is it happening because of the policies or because of the intention of a person?\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'English_rendering_of_PM’s_interaction_an.txt', 'Ministry': 'Prime_Ministers_Office', 'Month': 'Apr23html'}, page_content=\"We used to analyse everything. If necessary, we used to change the rules and policies so that the common man did not suffer. And if there was a problem because of the person, then we would take care of that person as well. As a result, SWAGAT had created a wonderful trust among the general public. And I believe that the biggest scale to measure the success of democracy is to find out how the public grievance redress system is working. What is the system of public hearing and what is the system of remedy. This is the test of democracy. Today I feel proud and satisfied when I see this seed named SWAGAT has become such a huge banyan tree. And I am happy that my old colleague AK Sharma, who was in charge of the SWAGAT program at that time and was posted in the CM office, has written a good article on SWAGAT sharing his experiences in the Economic Times today. Nowadays, he has also joined my profession, he has entered politics and is a minister in Uttar Pradesh, but at that time he used to handle the SWAGAT program as a government officer. Friends,\\nFor decades, there was a belief in our country that no matter which government comes to power it has to follow the status quo. Those running the government used to complete their tenure, cutting the ribbons and lighting lamps. But Gujarat has attempted to change this approach through SWAGAT. We emphasised that governance was not limited to rules, laws and status quo only. Governance happens through innovations! Governance is done through new ideas! Governance is not a lifeless system. Governance is a living system, governance is a sensitive system and governance is a progressive system related to people's lives, dreams and their resolutions. When SWAGAT was launched in 2003, technology and e-governance were not given much priority in the governments. Files were made for every work. No one knew where the files would disappear as it would go from one place to another. Mostly, once the application was given, the rest of the life of the complainant was spent in finding that paper. People were also less familiar with systems like video conferencing. Under these circumstances, Gujarat worked on futuristic ideas. And today, a system like SWAGAT has become an inspiration for a number of governance solutions. Many states are working on this system. I remember many state delegations used to come to Gujarat, study it and implement it in their states. When you sent me to Delhi, we made a system called 'PRAGATI' at the Centre to review the working of the government. PRAGATI has played an important role behind the rapid development of the country in the last nine years. This concept is also based on the idea of SWAGAT. As Prime Minister, I have reviewed projects worth about Rs 16 lakh crore in PRAGATI meetings. It has worked to speed up hundreds of projects in the country. Now the effect of PRAGATI is such that as soon as a project is listed for review, all the states end the obstacles related to it so that when it actually comes to me for review, they can say that it has been done two days back. Friends,\\nAs a seed gives birth to a tree, hundreds of branches come out of that tree and thousands of seeds give birth to thousands of new trees. Similarly, I am sure this idea of SWAGAT will give rise to thousands of new innovations in governance. It will continue to serve the public by becoming a model of public oriented governance. I am thankful to you that you gave me an opportunity once again to come among all of you. I am so busy with my work that I came to know through your invitation that it is completing 20 years. But I am happy that the initiative of governance is also being celebrated in such a way that it gets a new life, a new consciousness. It is my firm belief that now the SWAGAT program will progress with more enthusiasm and credibility. I convey my best wishes to all my dear brothers and sisters of Gujarat. And after a week, Gujarat will celebrate its Foundation Day on 1st May. And as it is, Gujarat turns the Foundation Day an opportunity for development and it makes a festival of development. Preparations must be going on with great fanfare. My best wishes to all of you.\"),\n",

Today, I am also virtually present among my near and dear ones from Tamil Nadu with the same spirit. I remember when I was the Chief Minister (of Gujarat), I had organized such a grand Saurashtra Sangamam in Madurai in 2010. More than 50,000 of our brothers and sisters from Saurashtra had come to participate in that event. And today, the same waves of affection and intimacy are visible on the land of Saurashtra. All of you have come in such a large number from Tamil Nadu to the land of your ancestors, to your homes. Seeing the happiness on your faces, I can say, you will take back a lot of memories and emotional experiences from here. You have also enjoyed tourism in Saurashtra a lot. You have also seen Sardar Patel's Statue of Unity, which connects the country from Saurashtra to Tamil Nadu. In other words, we can see the precious memories of the past, the affinity and experience of the present, and the resolutions and inspirations for the future in the 'Saurashtra-Tamil Sangamam'. I congratulate all the people of Saurashtra and Tamil Nadu for this wonderful event. Friends,\\nToday, we are witnessing a new tradition of cultural events like ‘Saurashtra-Tamil Sangamam’ in the ‘Amrit Kaal’ of independence. ‘Kashi-Tamil Sangamam’ was organized in Banaras just a few months ago, which was a matter of discussion in the whole country. Since then, many spontaneous efforts of such programs have been launched in different parts of the country. And, today we are witnessing the confluence of two ancient streams of India once again on the land of Saurashtra. This 'Saurashtra Tamil Sangamam' event is not just a confluence of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. It is also a celebration of the worship of 'Shakti' in the form of Goddess Meenakshi and Goddess Parvati. It is also a celebration of the spirit of ‘Shiva' in the form of Lord Somnath and Lord Ramnath. This ‘Sangamam’ is the confluence of the land of Nageshwar and Sundareshwar. This is the confluence of the land of Shri Krishna and Shri Ranganath. This is the confluence of Narmada and Vaigai. This is the confluence of Dandiya and Kolattam. This is the confluence of the traditions of holy cities like Dwarka and Madurai. And, this ‘Saurashtra-Tamil Sangamam’ is the confluence of Sardar Patel and Subramania Bharati's Nation First determination. We have to move forward with these resolutions. We have to move forward for nation building by taking this cultural heritage along. Friends,\\nIndia is a country that sees its diversity as a specialty. We are the people who celebrate diversity. We celebrate different languages and dialects, different arts and genres. From our faith to our spirituality, there is diversity everywhere. We worship Shiva, but the method of worship in the twelve Jyotirlingas has its own variations. We also research and worship Brahma in different forms as 'Eko Aham Bahusyam'. We bow down to different rivers of the country in mantras like 'Gange Cha Yamune Chaiva, Godavari Saraswati'. This diversity does not divide us, but strengthens our bond, our relationship. Because we know, when different streams come together, a confluence is created. Therefore, we have been nurturing these traditions for centuries, from the confluence of rivers to the confluence of ideas in events like Kumbh. This is the power of Sangam, which ‘Saurashtra Tamil Sangamam’ is taking forward in a new form today. Today, when the unity of the country is taking shape in the form of such great festivals, Sardar Sahib must be blessing us. It is also the fulfilment of the dreams of thousands and lakhs of freedom fighters of the country, who sacrificed their lives and dreamed of 'Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat'. Friends,\\nOn the completion of 75 years of independence, the country has invoked the 'Panch Prana' (five pledges) of 'Pride in Heritage'. The pride in our heritage will increase further when we get to know it, try to get to know ourselves by getting free from the mentality of slavery! Be it ‘Kashi Tamil Sangamam’ or ‘Saurashtra Tamil Sangamam’, these events are becoming an effective movement in this direction. You see, there is so much between Gujarat and Tamil Nadu that has been deliberately kept out of our knowledge. A little discussion of the migration from Saurashtra to Tamil Nadu during the period of foreign invasions was limited to some scholars of history. But even before that, there has been a deep connection between these two states since mythological times. This cultural fusion of Saurashtra and Tamil Nadu, of the West and the South, is a flow that has been in motion for thousands of years. Friends,\\nToday we have the goals of India of 2047. We also have the challenges of slavery and the seven decades that followed. We have to take the country forward, but on the way, there will be forces that break us apart and people who mislead us. But, India has the power to innovate even in the toughest of circumstances, the shared history of Saurashtra and Tamil Nadu gives us this assurance. You recall when foreign invaders started attacking India. The first such major attack was on the country's culture and honour in the form of Somnath. Centuries ago, there were no resources like we have today. There was no era of information technology and there were no fast trains and planes for commuting. But, our forefathers knew that हिमालयात् समारभ्य, यावत् इन्दु सरोवरम्। तं देव-निर्मितं देशं, हिन्दुस्थानं प्रचक्षते॥ That is, from the Himalayas to the Indian Ocean, this entire Devbhoomi is our own country India. That's why, they didn't worry that there would be new languages, new people, and a new environment so far away, so how would they live there. A large number of people migrated from Saurashtra to Tamil Nadu to protect their faith and identity. The people of Tamil Nadu welcomed them with open arms and extended all facilities to them for a new life. What can be a bigger and loftier example of ‘Ek Bharat, Shrestha Bharat’? Friends,\\nThe great saint Thiruvalluvar ji had said: अगन् अमर्न्दु, सेय्याळ् उरैयुम् मुगन् अमर्न्दु, नल् विरुन्दु, ओम्बुवान् इल् i.e. happiness, prosperity and fortune stays with those who happily welcome others into their home. Therefore, we have to emphasize harmony, not cultural clashes. We don't have to take forward the struggles; we have to take forward the Sangams and Samagams. We don't have to find differences; we want to make emotional connections. The people of Saurashtra origin settled in Tamil Nadu and the people of Tamilgam welcomed them. All of you adopted Tamil, but at the same time, remembered the language, food and customs of Saurashtra. This is the immortal tradition of India which takes everyone along and moves forward with inclusiveness, accepts everyone and moves forward. I am happy that we all are taking forward the contribution of our forefathers with a sense of duty. I would like you to invite people from different parts of the country in the same way at the local level and give them an opportunity to know and breathe India. I am sure ‘Saurashtra Tamil Sangamam’ will prove to be a historic initiative in this direction. With this spirit, I thank you once again that you came in such large numbers from Tamil Nadu. I would have enjoyed more had I personally come and welcome you there. But I could not come due to lack of time. But today I have got the opportunity to meet all of you virtually. We have to take the spirit that we have seen in this entire Sangamam forward. We have to follow that spirit. And we have to prepare our future generations as well for the same. Thank you very much.

Bharat Mata Ki Jai! The Governor of Madhya Pradesh\\xa0 Shri Mangubhai Patel, Chief Minister Shivraj ji, Railway Minister Ashwini ji, all other dignitaries, and my dear brothers and sisters of Bhopal who have come in large numbers! First of all, I express my grief over the tragedy at the Indore temple on Ramnavami. I pay my tribute to those who left us untimely due to this accident and express my condolences to their families. I also wish for the speedy recovery of the injured devotees who are undergoing treatment at the hospital. Friends,\\nToday MP got its first Vande Bharat Express train. Vande Bharat Express will make the journey between Bhopal and Delhi faster. This train will bring new facilities for professionals, youth and businessmen. Friends,\\nI have had the privilege of inaugurating the modern and grand Rani Kamalapati station where this event is being held. Today, you have given me the opportunity to flag off India's most modern Vande Bharat train from here to Delhi. In the history of Railways, it is very rare that a Prime Minister would come again at the same station in such a short interval. But in modern India, new culture and new systems are being developed. Today's event is also a perfect example of the same. Friends,\\nJust a short while back, I spent a few moments and interacted with some school children who were travelling as passengers. The curiosity and enthusiasm they had about this train was worth seeing. That is, in a way, the Vande Bharat train is a symbol of the enthusiasm and wave of development taking place in India. And when today's event was being finalised, I was told that the event would be on the 1st. I asked, why are you keeping it on 1st April? When the news comes out in the newspapers that Modi ji is going to flag off the Vande Bharat train on 1st April, then our friends from Congress will definitely give a statement that Modi is going to befool people on April Fool Day. But you see, this train has really been flagged off on 1st April itself. Friends,\\nIt is also a symbol of our skill, our capability and confidence. And this train to Bhopal is going to help boost tourism the most. Consequently, the number of tourists in tourist places like Sanchi Stupa, Bhimbetka, Bhojpur and Udayagiri caves is going to increase further. And you know very well that when tourism expands, many employment opportunities start rising and people's income also increases. That means, this Vande Bharat will also become a medium to increase the income of the people. And it will also become a medium to ensure the development of the region. Friends,\\nIndia of the 21st century is now working with a new thinking and a new approach. The previous governments were so busy in appeasement that they did not pay any attention to the contentment of the countrymen. They were busy with vote bank politics. But we are dedicated to the contentment of the countrymen. During the regime of previous governments, there was a lot of emphasis on one more thing. Those governments kept considering only one family of the country as the first family of the country. The poor and middle class families of the country were left to fend for themselves. There was no one to listen to the hopes and aspirations of these families. Our Indian Railways has been a living example of the same. Indian Railways is actually the transport of the ordinary Indian family. Parents, children, grandparents, maternal grandparents and everyone travel together in trains. So for decades, rail has been the biggest means of transportation for the people. Shouldn't this mode of transportation of the typical Indian family have been modernized with the time? Was it right to leave the railways in such a ramshackle condition? Friends,\\nAfter independence, India had got a huge ready-made railway network. If the governments of that time wanted, they could have modernized the railways very quickly. But for the sake of political expediency, for the sake of populist promises, the development of railways itself was sacrificed. The situation was such that even after so many decades of independence, our North Eastern states were not connected by trains. In the year 2014, when you gave me the opportunity to serve, I decided that this would not happen anymore. Now the railways would be revived. In the last 9 years, it has been our constant endeavour to ensure that Indian Railways becomes the best rail network in the world. You are very well aware of the news stories related to the Indian Railways before the year 2014. Such a huge rail network had thousands of unmanned gates all over the place. There were frequent reports of accidents. Sometimes there were heart wrenching news stories about the death of school children. Today the broad gauge network is free from unmanned gates. Earlier, news related to train accidents and loss of life and property would be heard every other day. Today Indian Railways has become much safer. 'Made in India' Kavach train protection system is being expanded in Railways to strengthen passenger safety. Friends,\\nThis safety is not only from accidents.\"),\n",

In case of emergency, assistance is provided quickly. Our sisters and daughters have benefitted the most from such an arrangement. Earlier there used to be a lot of complaints regarding cleanliness. Even staying for a while at railway stations seemed like a punishment. Moreover, the trains used to run late for several hours. Today the cleanliness is better and the complaints about the delay of trains are also continuously decreasing. Earlier the situation was such that people had stopped complaining because there was no one to listen to these complaints. You might remember that earlier black marketing of tickets was a very common complaint. Sting operations related to this were shown in the media. But today by using technology, we have solved many such problems. Friends,\\nToday, Indian Railways is also becoming a major medium to take the products of small craftsmen and artisans to every nook and corner of the country. Under the 'One Station, One Product' scheme, famous clothes, artworks, paintings, handicrafts, utensils etc. of the area in which the station is situated can be bought by passengers at the station itself. For this too, about 600 outlets have been set up in the country. I am glad that in a very short span of time more than one lakh passengers have made purchases from these outlets. Friends,\\nToday, Indian Railways is becoming synonymous with convenience for the ordinary families of the country. Today many railway stations are being modernized in the country. Today, Wi-Fi facilities are being provided at 6000 stations in the country. The installation of CCTVs at more than 900 major railway stations of the country has been completed. Our Vande Bharat Express has become a super hit in the whole country, especially among our young generation. The seats in these trains are getting filled throughout the year. There is a demand from every corner of the country for these Vande Bharat trains. Earlier the letters from MPs demanded that a certain train should have a stoppage at a particular station; or currently it stops at two stations but the stoppage should be increased to three, so on and so forth. Today I am proud to say that the MPs today write letters demanding Vande Bharat in their area as soon as possible.

But if there is willpower for development, the intention is clear and the loyalty is firm, then new paths also emerge. In the last 9 years, we have continuously increased the budget of the Railways. For Madhya Pradesh also this time a railway budget of more than Rs 13,000 crore has been allocated. Before 2014, the average railway budget for Madhya Pradesh was Rs 600 crore every year;\\xa0 just Rs 600 crore! Compare 600, with 13,000 crores today! Friends,\\nToday, the work of electrification is an example of the kind of modernization happening in the railways. Today, you are hearing every day that 100% electrification of the railway network has been achieved in one or the other part of the country. Madhya Pradesh is also included in the 11 states where 100 percent electrification has been achieved. Before 2014, every year on an average 600 kilometres of railway route was electrified. Now, on an average, 6000 kilometres are being electrified every year. This is the speed with which our government is working. Friends,\\nI am glad that today Madhya Pradesh has left the old days behind. Now Madhya Pradesh is writing a new saga of perpetual\\xa0 development. Be it agriculture or industry, today the strength of MP is expanding the strength of India. The performance of MP is commendable in most of the same parameters of development on which Madhya Pradesh was once called BIMARU. Today MP is among the leading states in building houses for the poor. Madhya Pradesh is also doing a good job in providing water to every household. Our farmers of Madhya Pradesh are creating new records in the production of various crops including wheat. Even in terms of industries, this state is now relentlessly moving towards new records. All these efforts are also creating possibilities of endless opportunities for the youth here. Friends,\\nIn the midst of these efforts being made for the development of the country, I would like to draw the attention of all the countrymen towards one more thing. There are some people in our country who have been determined since 2014 and have also spoken publicly and declared their resolution. So what have they done? They have declared their resolution to tarnish the image of Modi. For this, these people have given contracts to a number of different people and are also leading from the front. Some people are inside the country to support these people and some are outside the country doing that work. These people have been continuously trying to somehow tarnish the image of Modi. But today India's poor, India's middle class, India's tribals, India's Dalit-backward, and every Indian has become Modi's protective shield. And that's why these people are furious. These people are adopting new tricks. In 2014, they took a pledge to tarnish Modi's image. Now these people have taken a pledge – Modi, your grave will be dug. In the midst of their conspiracies, you, every countryman, have to pay attention to the development of the country and nation building. We have to further increase the role of Madhya Pradesh to achieve our aim of a developed India. This new Vande Bharat Express is a part of this resolution. Once again, my heartiest congratulations to all the people of Madhya Pradesh, and my brothers and sisters of Bhopal for this modern train. May we all have a pleasant journey! Thank you very much! Best wishes. DISCLAIMER: This is the approximate translation of PM’s speech. Original speech was delivered in Hindi. ***\\nDS/VJ/IG/AK\\n\"),\n",

The Prime Minister also conferred the Prime Minister’s Awards for Excellence in Public Administration and released the e-books ‘Viksit Bharat - Empowering Citizens & Reaching the last mile Volume I and II. Addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister congratulated everyone on the occasion of Civil Services Day. The Prime Minister noted that the occasion of Civil Services Day this year becomes much more special as the nation has completed 75 years of its independence and is starting to move forward to achieve the goals and objectives of a developed India. He highlighted the contributions of those Civil Servants who joined the service 15-25 years ago and emphasized the role of young officers who will contribute towards nation-building in the next 25 years of Amrit Kaal. The Prime Minister expressed confidence that the young officers are extremely fortunate to serve the nation in this Amrit Kaal. “The responsibility to accomplish the dreams of every freedom fighter of the nation lies upon every shoulder”, the Prime Minister remarked as he pointed out the paucity of time but the abundance of potential and courage in the country. The Prime Minister said that the country is prepared for take off due to the work done in the last 9 years. He said that different results are being obtained with the same bureaucracy and personnel. He acknowledged the role of Karamyogis in the growing profile of the country on the global stage, for the growing confidence of the poorest of the poor in ‘Sushasan’ and for a new momentum of development of the country. He mentioned India rising as the 5th largest economy in the world, taking strides in fintech as India is number one in digital transactions, one of the cheapest mobile data countries and the third largest startup ecosystem in the world. He remarked on transformative changes in the rural economy, railways, highways, port capacity augmentation and the number of airports. He said that the awards today reflect the contribution and sense of service of the Karmyogis. Recalling his address from the ramparts of the Red Fort on 15th August last year when the Prime Minister invoked the ‘Paanch Pran’ namely the development of Viksit Bharat or developed India, breaking the slavery mentality, taking pride in India’s heritage, strengthening the unity and diversity of the country, and keeping one’s duties before anything else, the Prime Minister underlined that the energy emanating from these five resolves will take the nation to its deserved place in the world. Dwelling on the theme of this year’s Civil Service Day being based on the notion of Viksit Bharat, the Prime Minister said that the concept of Viksit Bharat is not limited to modern infrastructure. “It is important for Viksit Bharat that India’s government system supports the aspirations of every Indian and every government servant helps every citizen in realizing their dreams and the negativity that was associated with the system in the previous years, turns into positivity”, the Prime Minister added. Throwing light on decades of experience after India’s independence, the Prime Minister stated the importance of last-mile delivery in the implementation of government schemes. He gave examples of results from policies of previous governments and mentioned that there were more than 4 crore fake gas connections, more than 4 crore fake ration cards, and support was provided to 1 crore fictitious women and children by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, fake scholarships were offered to approximately 30 lakh youths by Ministry of Minority Welfare, and lakhs of fake accounts were created under MGNREGA to transfer the benefits of workers who never existed. The Prime Minister highlighted that a corrupt ecosystem had emerged in the country under the pretext of these fake beneficiaries. He credited the civil servants for the transformation that has taken place in the system where roughly 3 lakh crore rupees have been saved from landing in the wrong hands, which is now being used for the welfare of the poor. The Prime Minister emphasized that when time is limited, it becomes very critical to decide the direction and working style. “Today's challenge is not about efficiency but in figuring out how to find and remove deficiencies”, he said. He recalled the time when in the garb of deficiency even the small aspect was attempted to be controlled. Today, he continued, the same deficiency is being turned into efficiency and removing obstacles in the system. “Earlier, the thinking was that the government will do everything, now the thinking is that the government will work for everyone”,\\xa0 said the Prime Minister highlighting the efficient use of time and resources to serve everyone. “Motto of the government is ‘Nation First-Citizen First’, today’s government’s priority is prioritizing the deprived”, the Prime Minister remarked, informing that the government is going up to Aspirational Districts and up to Aspirational blocks. He said today’s government is treating border villages as the first villages rather than the last villages. He said that for 100 percent saturation, we will need even more hard work and innovative solutions. He gave the example of departments asking for NoCs and information that is available somewhere in the system. He said for ease of living and ease of doing business we will have to find solutions for these. Giving the example of PM Gatishakti Master Plan, the Prime Minister explained that all data layers related to any infrastructure project can be found on a single platform and stressed the need to utilize it to the maximum for better planning and execution in the social sector. He further added that it will greatly benefit in identifying the needs of citizens, tackling issues related to education that might arise in the future, and enhancing communication between departments, districts and blocks while also helping in the formulation of future strategies. The Prime Minister stressed that the Amrit Kaal has brought immense challenges along with great opportunities. The Prime Minister elaborated that today’s aspirational citizens are not willing to wait for long to see changes in the systems and this will need our full effort, he said. Taking quick decisions and implementing them with speed has become all the more important as the expectations of the world from India have also risen dramatically. As the world is saying that India’s time has arrived, there is no time to be wasted by the bureaucracy of the country. “The country has put its faith in you, work while maintaining that trust. Basis of all your decisions should always be the national interest”, he insisted. Highlighting the importance and necessity of political parties with different ideologies in a democracy, the Prime Minister stressed the need for Bureaucracy to assess whether the political party in power is utilizing the taxpayers’ money for the benefit of the nation. “It is the duty of the Bureaucracy to analyze whether a political party is making use of taxpayers’ money for the benefit of their own organization or the nation’s”, the Prime Minister continued, “if it is using the money to create a vote bank or making the lives of the citizens easier; if it is advertising itself with the government treasure or making the people aware; if it is appointing its own party workers in various organizations or creating a transparent process for recruitment.” Recalling the words of Sardar Patel about the Bureaucracy being the steel frame of India, the Prime Minister said that it is time to live up to the expectations and prevent the dreams of the youth from getting crushed along with taxpayers’ money from being destroyed. The Prime Minister told the government servants that there are two approaches to life, first, getting things done and second letting things happen. The first is an active attitude and the second reflects a passive attitude. People with faith in getting things done take ownership in a proactive manner and become the driving force of their teams. “By this burning desire to bring change in the lives of the people you will be able to leave a memorable legacy. You will not be judged by what you have done for yourself but by what changes have you brought in the lives of the people”, the Prime Minister told the Karmyogis. Therefore, he said “Good governance is the key. People-centric governance solves problems and gives better results”, he said. He gave examples of Aspirational districts that are performing better than other districts on many development parameters due to good governance and the efforts of energetic young officers. By focussing on people’s participation a sense of ownership is created among the people and this people ownership ensures unprecedented results, he said. He illustrated this with examples of Swacch Bharat, Amrit Sarivar and Jal Jeevan Mission. The Prime Minister referred to the District Visions@100 that are under preparation and said that such visions should be prepared up to Panchayat Level. What sectors should be focussed in the Panchayats, blocks, district and the state, changes for attracting investment and identification of products that can be taken up for exports, a clear vision for all this should be developed, he said. He emphasized linking the chain of MSME and Self-Help Groups to promote local products and said “It is very important for all of you to encourage local talent, promote local entrepreneurship and start-up culture.”\\nUnderlining that he has been the head of the government for more than 20 years now, the Prime Minister expressed delight at getting the opportunity to work with civil servants. He emphasized capacity building and expressed happiness that ‘Mission Karmayogi’ has become a huge campaign among all civil servants. He underlined that the Capacity Building Commission is taking this campaign forward with full force and said, “The aim of Mission Karmayogi is to utilize the full potential of civil servants.” Highlighting the iGOT platform that has been created to ensure the availability of quality training material everywhere, the Prime Minister stressed that training and learning should not remain a formality for a few months. “Now, all the recruits are also being trained on iGOT platform with the orientation module of ‘Karmayogi Prarambh’”, Shri Modi added. Highlighting the government’s initiative to do away with the protocol of hierarchy, the Prime Minister said that he constantly meets the secretaries, assistant secretaries, and trainee officers. He also gave the example of brainstorming camps to increase everyone's participation within the department for new ideas. He also stated that the issue of officers getting work experience in the Central Government on deputation only after living in the states for the first years has been addressed by filling the gap through the assistant secretary programme where young IAS officers now get a chance to work in the Central Government at the very beginning of their career. The Prime Minister said that 25 years of Amrit journey is considered a time of duty (Kartavya Kaal). “The century of independence will be the golden century of the country when we will give first priority to our duties. Duty is not an option for us but a resolution”, the Prime Minister stressed. “This is the time of rapid change. Your role will also be determined not by your rights, but by your duties and their performance. The power of the citizens of the country has increased in the new India, the power of India has increased. You have got an opportunity to play an important role in this new emerging India.”, he added. Concluding the address, the Prime Minister stated that young civil servants have the opportunity to make a mark of prominence in history when the accomplishments of the nation will be evaluated after 100 years of independence. “You can say with pride that I have played a role in creating new systems for the country and also improving it. I am sure all of you will continue to expand your role in nation-building”, Shri Modi concluded. Union Minister of State for Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Dr Jitendra Singh, Principal Secretary to Prime Minister, Shri P K Mishra, Cabinet Secretary, Shri Rajiv Gauba and Secretary, Department of Administrative Reforms & Public Grievances, Shri V Srinivas were present on the occasion. Background\\nThe Prime Minister has constantly appreciated the contribution of Civil Servants towards nation-building and enthused them to work even harder. The programme served as an apt platform for the Prime Minister to motivate and inspire Civil Servants across the country so that they may keep serving the nation with the same zeal, especially during this crucial phase of Amrit Kaal. During the event, the Prime Minister also conferred the Prime Minister’s Awards for Excellence in Public Administration as well. These have been instituted with a view to recognize the extraordinary and innovative work done by districts & organizations of the Central and State Governments for the welfare of common citizens. Awards will be given for exemplary work done in four identified priority programmes: Promoting Swachh Jal through Har Ghar Jal Yojana; Promoting Swasth Bharat through Health & Wellness Centres; Promoting quality education with an equitable and inclusive classroom environment through Samagra Shiksha; Holistic Development through Aspirational District\\xa0 Programme - overall progress with special focus on saturation approach. Eight awards for the above four identified programmes will be given while seven awards shall be given for innovations.

The Prime Minister outlined some priorities for discussion for disaster resilience infrastructure in the context of this year's theme of ‘Delivering Resilient and Inclusive Infrastructure’. The Prime MInister said “Infrastructure is not only about returns but also about reach and resilience. Infrastructure must leave none behind and serve the people even during times of crisis.” The Prime Minister stressed the need for a holistic view of infrastructure as social and digital infrastructure are as important as transport infrastructure. Along with quick relief, the Prime Minister emphasized the need to focus on early restoration of normalcy too. “Resilience is built in the times between one disaster and another. Studying past disasters and learning lessons from them is the way”, he added. Shri Modi underlined the intelligent use of local knowledge of building infrastructures that can with-stand disasters. Modern technology with local insights can be great for resilience. Further, if documented well, local knowledge may become a global best practice, the Prime Minister said.

Addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister drew attention to the fact that hosting a guest is a special experience but the experience and happiness of homecoming after decades is unmatchable. He highlighted that the people of Saurashtra have laid down the red carpet for friends from Tamil Nadu who are visiting the state with the same enthusiasm. The Prime Minister remembered that as Chief Minister he organized a similar Saurashtra Tamil Sangamam in Madurai in 2010 with more than 50,000 participants from Saurashtra. The Prime Minister noted the same affection and fervour in the guests from Tamil Nadu who have come to Saurashtra. Noting that the guests have indulged in tourism and already visited the Statue of Unity in Kevadia, the Prime Minister said that one can witness the precious memories of the past, affinity and experiences for the present, and resolutions and inspirations for the future in the Saurashtra Tamil Sangamam. He congratulated everyone from Saurashtra and Tamil Nadu for today’s occasion. The Prime Minister said that in the Amrit Kaal of India’s Independence, we are bearing witness to important cultural events like Saurashtra Tamil Sangamam which is not a sangam of just Tamil Nadu and Saurashtra but also a festival of worship of Shakti in the form of Devi Meenakshi and Devi Parvati. Also, this is a festival of the Spirit of Shiva in the form of Bhagan Somnath and Bhagwan Ramnath. Similarly, it is a sangam of the land of Sundershwara and Nageshwara, this is the sangam of Shri Krishna and Shri Ranganatha, Narmada and Vagai, Dandiya and Kolatham and a sangam of the sacred tradition of Puris like Dwarka and Puri, he said. “Tamil Saurashtra Sangamam is a sangam of patriotic resolution of Sardar Patel and Subramania Bharati. We have to move forward with this heritage on the path of nation-building”, the Prime Minister added. “India is a country that sees its diversity as a speciality”, the Prime Minister said referring to the different languages and dialects, art forms and genres that are celebrated all over the country. The Prime Minister emphasized that India finds diversity in its belief and spirituality and gave the example of worshipping Lord Shiva and Lord Brahma and bowing our heads to the holy rivers of the land in our own diverse ways. This diversity, the Prime Minister continued, does not divide us but strengthens our bonds and relationships. He underlined that a confluence is created when different streams come together and said that India has been nurturing the notion of the confluence of rivers to the confluence of ideas in events like Kumbh for centuries. “This is the power of Sangam that the Saurashtra Tamil Sangamam is taking forward in a new form today”, the Prime Minister remarked. He elaborated that the unity of the country is taking shape in the form of such great festivals with the blessings of Sardar Patel Saheb. The Prime Minister emphasized that it is also the fulfillment of the dreams of lakhs of freedom fighters who sacrificed their lives and dreamed of 'Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat'. The Prime Minister recalled the ‘Panch Pran’ of pride in heritage and said “Pride in our heritage will increase when we get to know it, try to get to know ourselves by getting free from the mentality of slavery.” Events like Kashi Tamil Sangamam and Saurashtra Tamil Sangamam are becoming an effective movement in this direction, he said. He commented upon the neglect of the deep connection between Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. The Prime Minister noted “There has been a deep connection between these two states since mythological times. This cultural fusion of Saurashtra and Tamil Nadu, of the West and the South is a flow that has been in motion for thousands of years.”\\nMentioning the goal of 2047, the challenges of slavery and 7 decades, the Prime Minister cautioned against diversionary and destructive powers. “India has the power to innovate even in the toughest of circumstances, the shared history of Saurashtra and Tamil Nadu assures us of this”, he said. The Prime Minister remembered the attack on Somnath and the resultant exodus to Tamil Nadu and recalled that those moving from one part of the country to another never worried about the new language, people and environment. He reiterated that a large number of people migrated from Saurashtra to Tamil Nadu to protect their faith and identity and the people of Tamil Nadu welcomed them with open arms, and extended all facilities to them for a new life. “What can be a bigger and loftier example of\\xa0 ‘Ek Bharat, Shresth Bharat’?”, the Prime Minister exclaimed. Quoting the great saint Thiruvallavar the Prime Minister said that happiness, prosperity and fortune come to those who happily welcome others into their homes and emphasized the need for harmony and shunning cultural clashes. “We don't have to take forward the struggles, we have to take forward the Sangams and Samagams. We don't want to find differences, we want to make emotional connections”, the Prime Minister said referring to the people of Tamil Nadu who welcomed the people of Saurashtra origin to settle in Tamil Nadu. He said that the immortal tradition of India which takes everyone along with inclusiveness and moves forward has been showcased by those who adopted the Tamil culture but at the same time remembered the language, food and customs of Saurashtra. The Prime Minister expressed delight that the contributions of our forefathers are being taken forward with a sense of duty. Concluding the address, the Prime Minister urged everyone to invite people from different parts of the country in the same way as the local level and give them an opportunity to live and breathe India. He expressed confidence that the Saurashtra Tamil Sangamam will prove to be a historic initiative in this direction. Background\\nThe genesis of the programme lies in the vision of the Prime Minister of promoting the spirit of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat through initiatives which bring out and help rediscover the age-old links between people in different parts of the country. With this in mind, the Kashi Tamil Sangamam was organized earlier and the Saurashtra Tamil Sangamam takes forward this vision by celebrating the shared culture and heritage between Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. Centuries ago, many people migrated to Tamil Nadu from the Saurashtra region. The Saurashtra Tamil Sangamam provided an opportunity for Saurashtrian Tamils to reconnect with their roots. The 10-day confluence saw more than 3000 Saurashtrian Tamils come to Somnath on a special train. The programme began on 17th April, with its closing ceremony now being held on 26th April at Somnath. Glad to see the enthusiasm for Saurashtra-Tamil Sangamam. This initiative will further cultural exchange. https://t.co/4ZQfyiT5hp\\nआज आजादी के अमृतकाल में हम सौराष्ट्र-तमिल संगमम् जैसे सांस्कृतिक आयोजनों की एक नई परंपरा के गवाह बन रहे हैं। pic.twitter.com/YEybyX7sZb\\nभारत विविधता को विशेषता के रूप में जीने वाला देश है। pic.twitter.com/xcU41P34xD\\nदेश ने अपनी ‘विरासत पर गर्व’ के ‘पंच प्राण’ का आवाहन किया है। pic.twitter.com/fWfJka9Dqu\\nभारत कठिन से कठिन हालातों में भी कुछ नया करने की ताकत रखता है। pic.twitter.com/iVHtCgemJ4\\nभारत की अमर परंपरा है - सबको साथ लेकर समावेश के साथ आगे बढ़ने की, सबको स्वीकार करके आगे बढ़ने की। pic.twitter.com/LIJzKnlpwL\\n\\n***\\nDS/TS\\n\"),\n",

He mentioned peace missions and India’s whole-hearted efforts in rescue work for disasters like the earthquake in Turkiye. “This emotion of 140 crore Indians is being seen, understood and accepted by the world”, he said. Platforms like IBC, he continued, are giving the opportunity to like-minded and like-hearted countries to spread Buddha Dhamma and peace. The Prime Minister said, “The journey from the problem to arriving at the solution is the actual journey of Buddha.” Throwing light on Lord Buddha’s journey, the Prime Minister reiterated that he left his life of castles and kingdoms because he realized the pain in the lives of others. He emphasized the only way to achieve the goal of a prosperous world is when one gives away the idea of self and narrow-mindedness and realizes the totality of the Buddha Mantra of adopting the idea of the world. He stressed that a better and stable world can be achieved only if we consider the nations dealing with a scarcity of resources. “It is the need of the hour that the priority of every person and nation should be the interest of the world along with the interest of the country”, the Prime Minister remarked. The Prime Minister said that the current time is the most challenging time of this century as there is war, economic instability, terrorism and religious fanaticism, and the challenge of climate change with species disappearing and glaciers melting. He said amidst all this there are people who believe in Buddha and the welfare of all creatures.'),\n",

When this hope gets united, the Buddha's Dhamma will become the world's belief and Buddha's realization will become the belief of humanity. Shri Modi underscored the relevance of Buddha’s teaching by saying that all the problems of modern times lend themselves to solutions through the ancient teachings of the Lord. Lord Buddha, the Prime Minister said, preached abandoning war, defeat and victory for eternal peace. He said enmity can never be countered with enmity and happiness lies in unity. Similarly, Lord Buddha’s teaching that one should first look at the conduct of the self before preaching to others can address the menace of imposing one’s own views on others so prevalent in today’s world. The Prime Minister came back to his favourite Buddha teaching अप्प दीपो भवः, be your own light to elaborate the eternal relevance of the Lord’s teachings. He remembered telling the United Nations a few years ago that ‘we are the country that has given the world Buddh, not Yudh (war)’. The Prime Minister said “The path of Buddha is the path of the future and the path of sustainability. Had the world followed Buddha’s teachings, it would not have faced the problem of climate change.” This problem arose, the Prime Minister explained, as nations stopped thinking about others and coming generations. This mistake accumulated to catastrophic proportions. Buddha preached good conduct without any consideration of personal gain as such behavior leads to overall good. The Prime\\xa0 Minister highlighted how each person is affecting the earth in one way or the other, be it with lifestyle, eating or traveling habits and pointed out that everyone can contribute towards fighting climate change. Throwing light on Lifestyle For Environment or Mission LiFE, an initiative by India influenced by the inspirations of Buddha the Prime Minister said that if people become aware and change their lifestyle, then this huge problem of climate change can also be tackled. “Mission LiFE is influenced by the inspirations of Buddha and it furthers Buddha’s thoughts”, Shri Modi remarked. Concluding the address, the Prime Minister stressed the need to come out of the definitions of materialism and selfishness and imbibe the feeling of 'Bhavatu Sab Mangalan' i.e. Buddha should not only be made a symbol but also a reflection. He remarked that this resolution will be fulfilled only when we remember the words of the Buddha of not turning back and always moving forward. The Prime Minister expressed confidence that resolutions will become successful with everyone coming together. Union Minister for Culture, Shri G Kishan Reddy, Union Minister for Law and Justice, Shri Kiren Rijiju, Union Ministers of State for Culture, Shri Arjun Ram Meghwal and Smt Meenakshi Lekhi, and Secretary General of International Buddhist Confederation, Dr Dhammapiya were present on occasion. Background\\nThe two-day Summit is being hosted by the Ministry of Culture in collaboration with International Buddhist Confederation on 20-21 April. The theme of the Global Buddhist Summit is “Responses to Contemporary Challenges: Philosophy to Praxis”. The Summit is an effort towards engaging the global Buddhist Dhamma leadership and scholars on matters of Buddhist and universal concerns, and to come up with policy inputs to address them collectively. The discussion at the Summit explored how the Buddha Dhamma’s\\xa0 fundamental values can provide inspiration and guidance in contemporary settings. The Summit witnessed the participation of eminent scholars, Sangha leaders and Dharma practitioners from all over the world, who will discuss pressing global issues and look for answers in the Buddha Dhamma based on universal values. The discussions were held under four themes: Buddha Dhamma and Peace; Buddha Dhamma: Environmental Crisis, Health and Sustainability; Preservation of Nalanda Buddhist Tradition; Buddha Dhamma Pilgrimage, Living Heritage and Buddha Relics: a resilient foundation to India’s centuries-old cultural links to countries in South, South-East and East Asia. The noble teachings of Gautama Buddha have impacted countless people over centuries. https://t.co/M5PuhMbbas\\nबुद्ध व्यक्ति से आगे बढ़कर एक बोध हैं।बुद्ध स्वरूप से आगे बढ़कर एक सोच हैं।बुद्ध चित्रण से आगे बढ़कर एक चेतना हैं। pic.twitter.com/ipGZreYYaS\\nInspired by teachings of Lord Buddha, India is taking new initiatives for global welfare. pic.twitter.com/KLlHv9eJ6K\\nहमने भगवान बुद्ध के मूल्यों का निरंतर प्रसार किया है। pic.twitter.com/Sfp6ehuid2\\nभारत विश्व के हर मानव के दुःख को अपना दुःख समझता है। pic.twitter.com/zXuyTIjNc2\\nसमस्याओं से समाधान की यात्रा ही बुद्ध की यात्रा है। pic.twitter.com/nMxaLFJzMr\\nआज दुनिया जिस युद्ध और अशांति से पीड़ित है, बुद्ध ने सदियों पहले इसका समाधान दिया था। pic.twitter.com/cmPMsYMgIk\\nभारत ने दुनिया को युद्ध नहीं बुद्ध दिए हैं। pic.twitter.com/lXWNyN9yF1\\nबुद्ध का मार्ग भविष्य का मार्ग है, sustainability का मार्ग है। pic.twitter.com/XEdTYcPWyn\\n\\n***\\nDS/TS\\n\"),\n",

The Prime Minister began his address by conveying his best wishes on the occasion of Ganga Pushkaralu Utsav and extended a warm welcome to everyone\\xa0 He said that all those present here are his personal guest, and guests share the same status as God in the Indian culture.“Even though I could not be present there to welcome you, my mind is with you all”, said the Prime Minister. He congratulated the Kashi-Telugu Committee and Member of Parliament, Shri GVL Narasimha Rao for organizing this event. Underlining that the Ganga - Pushkaralu Utsav at the ghats of Kashi is like the confluence of the Ganges and the Godavari, the Prime Minister said that it is a celebration of the confluence of ancient civilizations, cultures and traditions of India. He recalled the Kashi - Tamil Sangamam that took place here a few months ago and also mentioned participating in the Saurashtra - Tamil Sangamam a few days ago where he had analogized Azadi Ka Amrit Kaal as a confluence of diversities and cultures of India. “This confluence of diversities is giving rise to the Amrit of nationalism which will ensure full energy for India in the future”, the Prime Minister said. Throwing light on the deep connections of Kashi and its residents with Telugus, the Prime Minister said that Kashi has been welcoming them for generations and the relationship is as ancient as the city itself. He remarked that the faith of people from Telugu background in Kashi is as sacred as Kashi. He noted that people from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana constitute a significant number of the number of pilgrims who visit Kashi. “Telugu states have given Kashi so many great saints, so many Acharyas and sages”, the Prime Minister said as he underlined that when the people of Kashi and the pilgrims go to visit Baba Vishwanath, they also visit Tailang Swami's ashram to seek his blessings. The Prime Minister mentioned Tailang Swami who was born in Vizianagaram but was called the living Shiva of Kashi by Swami Ramakrishna Paramhans. He also mentioned great souls like Jiddu Krishnamurti and others who are fondly remembered in Kashi even today. The Prime Minister emphasized that Telugu people have kept Kashi attached to their souls exactly like Kashi adopted and understood them, and mentioned the holy shrine Vemulawada which is called Dakshina Kashi. He underlined that the black thread which is tied on the hands in the temples of Andhra and Telangana is called Kashi Daram. Highlighting that the glory of Kashi is deeply embedded in the Telugu language and literature, the Prime Minister mentioned the Kashi Khandamu Granth by Srinath Mahakavi, the Kashi Yatra character of Engul Viraswamayya and the popular Kashi Majili Kathalu. Emphasizing how an outsider might find it hard to believe how a city so far away can be so close to the heart, the Prime Minister said, “This is the heritage of India which has kept the belief of ‘Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat’ alive for centuries.”\\n“Kashi is the land of liberation and salvation”, the Prime Minister remarked. Recalling the times when Telugu people used to walk thousands of kilometers to reach Kashi, the Prime Minister said that circumstances are transforming rapidly in the modern days. He gave the examples of the divine splendor of Vishwanath Dham on one hand and the grandeur of the ghats of Ganga ghats on the other; streets of Kashi on one side and expanding network of new roads and highways on the other. He underlined that those from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana who have come to Kashi earlier must be feeling the change taking place in the city and mentioned the reduction in time taken to reach Dashashwamedh Ghat from the airport owing to the construction of a new highway. Giving examples of development in the city, the Prime Minister mentioned the undergrounding of electric wires in most areas, the rejuvenation of kunds, temple pathways and cultural places in the city, and the plying of CNG boats on the Ganges. He also stated the upcoming ropeway that will benefit the citizens of Kashi. The Prime Minister credited the residents and the youth of the city for creating a mass movement when it came to cleanliness campaigns and the cleanliness of the ghats. The Prime Minister expressed confidence that the people of Kashi will leave no stone unturned to serve and welcome the guests. “Baba's blessings, the darshan of Kaal Bhairav and Maa Annapurna is wonderful in itself. A dip in Ganga ji will make your soul happy”, the Prime Minister remarked as he also mentioned that delicacies like lassi, thandai, Chaat, Litti-Chokha, and Banarasi Paan will make the trip even more memorable. The Prime Minister also highlighted the wooden toys of Varanasi similar to the Etikoppaka Toys and Banarasi sarees that compatriots from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana can take with them. “Our forefathers established the consciousness of India in different centers which together make for the complete form of Mother India”, the Prime Minister said. He highlighted Baba Vishwanath and Vishalakshi Shaktipeeth in Kashi, Mallikarjuna in Andhra, Bhagwan Raj-Rajeshwar in Telangana, Maa Bhramaramba in Andhra, and Raj Rajeshwari in Telangana and said that all such holy places are important centers of India and its cultural identity. Concluding the address, the Prime Minister underlined that India’s completeness and full potential can be realized only when we see the diversity of the country in its totality. “Only then we will be able to awaken our full potential”, Shri Modi said. He expressed confidence that festivals like Ganga-Pushkaralu will continue to take forward this resolution of national service. Kashi-Telugu Sangamam is a unique programme that celebrates cultural diversity and furthers the spirit of 'Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat.' https://t.co/Tt8oUGhY6b\\n*****\\nDS/TS\\n\"),\n",

Addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister started his speech by bowing to Maa Vidhyawasini and to the land of bravery. He recalled his visits earlier and the affection of the people here. The Prime Minister noted the virtual presence of more than 30 lakh Panchayat representatives from all over the country and said that it presents a bold picture of Indian democracy. He pointed out that the scope of work for each one present here might be different but everyone works for the common goal of serving the citizens through serving the country. The Prime Minister expressed happiness that the Panchayats are implementing the government’s schemes for Gaaon aur Gareeb - villages and the poor, with full dedication. Referring to eGramSwaraj and GeM portal for public procurement at the Panchayat level, the Prime Minister said that it will ease the working of the Panchayats. He also mentioned the distribution of 35 lakh SVAMITVA Property Cards and projects worth 17000 crores regarding railways, housing, water and employment for the development of Madhya Pradesh. In the Amrit Kaal of Independence, the Prime Minister said, every citizen is working towards fulfilling the dream of a developed India with utmost dedication. He highlighted the importance of developing the social system, economy and Panchayati Raj system in the villages of India in order to create a developed nation and pointed out that the present government is working tirelessly to create a robust system in place and expanding its scope, unlike the previous governments that discriminated with the Panchayats. Throwing light on the lack of efforts made by the previous governments before 2014, the Prime Minister informed that the finance commission granted less than 70,000 crores which was a paltry amount when one considers the scale of the country, but after 2014, this grant was increased to more than 2 lakh crores. He also mentioned that merely 6,000 Panchayat Bhawans were constructed a decade before 2014, whereas the present government constructed more than 30,000 Panchayat Bhawans in the last 8 years. He also informed that less than 70 Gram Panchayats were connected with optical fiber compared to more than 2 lakh Gram Panchayats that got optical fiber connectivity after the present government came to power. He also noted the lack of faith shown in the existing Panchayati Raj system by the previous governments after India’s independence. Recalling the words of Mahatma Gandhi that ‘India lives in its villages’, the Prime Minister pointed out that the previous regime barely paid any heed to his ideology which resulted in the Panchayati Raj remaining neglected for decades. The Prime Minister said that today, Panchayats are coming up as the life force of India’s development. “Gram Panchayat Vikas Yojana is helping Panchayats to work effectively”, Shri Modi added. The Prime Minister said that the government is working ceaselessly to bridge the gap between villages and cities. Panchayats are being made smart in this age of the digital revolution. Technology is being harnessed in the projects being undertaken by the Panchayats. The Prime Minister gave the example of Amrit Sarovar where issues like the selection of sites and completion of the project are being done with the help of technology. He said the GeM portal for public procurement at the Panchayat level will make procurement by the Panchayats easy and transparent. Local cottage industry will find a strong avenue for their sales, the Prime Minister said. The Prime Minister talked about the benefit of technology in the PM Svamitva scheme. He informed that the scheme is changing the scene of property rights in villages and reducing disputes and litigation. The use of drone technology is ensuring property documents for the people without any discrimination. He informed that work of Property Card is completed in 75 thousand villages of the country. He praised the Madhya Pradesh Government for good work in this direction. Referring to the indifference to the development of Chhindwara, the Prime Minister blamed the thinking of certain political parties. He said that the ruling parties broke the trust of the rural poor by ignoring the basic needs of the rural areas after Independence. The Prime Minister emphasized that by discriminating against villages where half of the population of the country resides, the country can not progress. He said after 2014, the rural economy, facilities in villages and the interest of the villages were given the highest priority. He said schemes like Ujjwala, and PM Awas have left a deep impact in villages. He said out of 4.5 crore houses, 3 crore houses of PMAY are in rural areas and that too mostly, in the name of the women. Highlighting that the cost of every house constructed under PM Awas Yojna is more than 1 lakh, the Prime Minister said that the government has transformed the lives of crores of women from the country by making them ‘Lakhpati Didi’ (millionaires). He informed that more than 4 lakh families have performed Grih Pravesh in pucca houses today and congratulated the sisters who have now become homeowners. The Prime Minister also touched upon the PM Saubhagya Yojna and informed that out of the 2.5 crore houses that received electricity, most of the houses belonged to the rural areas and the Har Ghar Jal Yojna that resulted in tapped water connections to more than 9 crore rural households. He pointed out that approximately 60 lakh houses in Madhya Pradesh now have tapped water connections compared to 13 lakhs previously. Stressing the need for access to banks and bank accounts, the Prime Minister pointed out that most of the rural population neither had bank accounts nor availed of any services from banks. As a result, the Prime Minister continued, the monetary aid that was sent out to the beneficiaries got looted before it reached them. Throwing light on the Jan Dhan Yojna, the Prime Minister informed that bank accounts were opened for more than 40 crore residents from villages, and the reach of banks was widened through India Post Payments Bank via India Post Office. He also gave the example of Bank Mitras and trained Bank Sakhis that are helping the people of the villages in everything, be it farming or business. Shedding light on the great injustice caused to the villages of India by previous governments, the Prime Minister noted that money spending on villages was avoided as villages were not considered to be vote banks. The Prime Minister highlighted that the present government opened the doors of development of the villages by spending more than 3.5 lakh crores on Har Ghar Jal Yojana, lakhs of crores of rupees are spent on PM Awas Yojana, 1 lakh crore rupees is being spent to complete the irrigation projects lying incomplete for decades, and thousands of crores of rupees are being spent on PM Gramin Sadak Abhiyan. Even under PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, the Prime Minister continued, the government has transferred about Rs 2.5 lakh crores directly to the bank accounts of the farmers where about 90 lakh farmers of Madhya Pradesh have received 18,500 crore rupees as part of this scheme. “The farmers of Rewa have also received about Rs 500 crore from this fund”, he added. The Prime Minister noted that thousands of crores of rupees have reached the villages in addition to the increase in MSP, while in the Corona period, the government has been giving free rations to the poor for the last three years at a cost of more than Rs 3 lakh crores. Referring to the Mudra Yojna, the Prime Minister informed that the central government is creating employment and self-employment opportunities in the villages by providing assistance of Rs 24 lakh crore in the past years alone. Due to this, the Prime Minister said, crores of people have started their employment in the villages where women make for a huge number of beneficiaries. Shri Modi informed that in the last 9 years, 9 crore women have joined self-help groups including more than 50 lakh women from Madhya Pradesh, and the government is offering a loan of up to Rs 20 lakh without bank guarantee to every self-help group. “Women are now handling the command of many small-scale industries”, the Prime Minister remarked, referring to the ‘Didi Cafe’ set up by the state government in every district. Shri Modi congratulated the women power of Madhya Pradesh and informed that about 17,000 women associated with self-help groups have been elected as panchayat representatives in the last panchayat elections. Referring to the ‘Samaveshi Abhiyan launched today, the Prime Minister said that this will be a strong initiative for achieving Viksit Bharat through Sabka Vikas. “Every panchayat, every institution, every representative, every citizen of the country will have to unite for a developed India. This is possible only when every basic facility reaches 100% beneficiaries quickly and without any discrimination”, he said. The Prime Minister emphasized that Panchayats will have to spread awareness about new systems of agriculture. He especially stressed the need to propagate natural farming. He said Panchayats have a big role to play in the initiative for small farmers, fishermen, and animal husbandry. “When you get involved in every development-related activity, the collective efforts of the nation will get strengthened. This will become the energy for building a developed India in Amrit Kaal.”\\nHighlighting the projects of today, the Prime Minister mentioned the electrification of the Chhindwara-Nainpur-Mandla Fort rail line which will further ease the connectivity of the people of this region to Delhi-Chennai and Howrah-Mumbai while also benefiting the tribal population. He also mentioned the new trains that have also been flagged off today for Chhindwara-Nainpur and said that many towns and villages will be directly connected to their district headquarters in Chhindwara, Seoni, and going to Nagpur and Jabalpur will also become much easier. The Prime Minister noted the rich wildlife in the region and said that increasing connectivity will also boost tourism and create new employment opportunities. “This is the power of the double-engine government”, the Prime Minister said.'),\n",

Addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister greeted the nation on the auspicious occasion of Baisakhi. He congratulated the candidates and their families for getting the appointment letter. The Prime Minister remarked that the government is committed to providing the right opportunities for the talent and energy of the youth to achieve the resolutions of a developed India. The Prime Minister highlighted that the process for government recruitment is taking place at a fast pace in NDA-ruled states from Gujarat to Assam and Uttar Pradesh to Maharashtra. He noted that recruitment letters to more than 22,000 teachers were handed out in Madhya Pradesh only yesterday. “This Rozgar Mela is proof of our commitment towards the youth of the nation.”\\nNoting that India is one of the fastest growing economies of the world, the Prime Minister said that the world is seeing India as a bright spot amidst the global challenges of recession and pandemic. “Today’s New India is moving with policies and strategies that have opened the doors for new possibilities”, he added. He said that after 2014, India adopted a proactive approach as opposed to the reactive stance of the earlier times. “This has resulted in a situation where this third decade of the 21st century is witnessing opportunities for employment and self-employment that were unimaginable earlier. Youth is finding such sectors which did not even exist ten years ago”, the Prime Minister said. Giving examples of startups and Indian youth’s enthusiasm, the Prime Minister referred to a report that said that startups have created more than 40 lakh direct or indirect jobs. He also mentioned drones and the sports sector as new avenues of employment. The Prime Minister said “The thinking and approach of Aatmnirbhar Bharat Abhiyan go beyond adopting swadeshi and ‘vocal for local’. Aatmnirbhar Bharat Abhiyan is an ‘abhiyan’ of creating crores of employment opportunities from villages to cities.” He gave examples of indigenously made modern satellites and semi-high-speed trains. He said that more than 30000 LHB coaches have been manufactured in India in the last 8-9 years. Technology and raw materials for these coaches have created thousands of jobs in India. Giving the example of India’s toy industry, the Prime Minister pointed out that the children of India only played with imported toys for decades. He also stated that the toys were neither of good quality nor were they designed while keeping in mind Indian children. The Prime Minister informed that the government laid the benchmark for the quality parameters of imported toys and also started promoting the indigenous toy industry. As a result, the Prime Minister added that the face of the toy industry in India completely transformed and also played a key role in creating numerous job opportunities. Countering the prevalent decade-old mindset that defence equipment in India could only be imported, the Prime Minister highlighted that the government changed this approach by trusting indigenous manufacturers which resulted in the armed forces creating a list of more than 300 equipment and weapons that would only be made in India. He informed that Rs 15,000 crores worth of defence equipment is being exported all around the world. Shri Modi also mentioned the strides made in the field of mobile phone manufacturing in the last few years. He said that by encouraging local manufacturing and providing incentives for that, India saved a lot of foreign exchange as India is now exporting mobile handsets along with meeting the local demand. The Prime Minister also highlighted the role of investment in infrastructure in employment generation. He said that emphasis on capital expenditure is creating infrastructure like roads, railways, ports and buildings. Highlighting the employment potential of infrastructure, the Prime Minister informed that during the tenure of the present government capital expenditure has grown four-fold. Giving the example of the developments before and after 2014,\\xa0 the Prime Minister mentioned Indian Railway and pointed out that in the past seven decades before 2014, merely 20,000 kilometers of electrification of railway tracks took place, whereas 40,000 kilometers of rail lines have been electrified in the last 9 years. He also informed that the laying of metro rail lines increased from 600 meters per month before 2014, to 6 kilometers per month today. He further added that the gas network was limited to less than 70 districts in the country before 2014, whereas today this number has gone up to 630 districts. Speaking about the length of roads in rural areas, the Prime Minister noted that it saw an increase from 4 lakh kilometers to 7 lakh kilometers after 2014. “When roads reach the villages, it leads to rapid employment generation in the entire ecosystem”, he added. Speaking about the aviation sector, Shri Modi informed that the number of airports has grown from 74 in 2014 to 148 today. He also pointed to the employment potential of airport operations. He also mentioned the record order for aircrafts by Air India and similar plans of some other companies. The Port sector is also witnessing similar progress, he said, as cargo handling has doubled compared to the past and time has been cut down to half. These developments are creating a large number of jobs. Shifting to the health sector, the Prime Minister said that while there were less than 400 medical colleges in the country before 2014, today there are 660 medical colleges. Similarly, undergraduate medical seats have grown to more than 1 lakh from 50 thousand in 2014 and more than double the number of doctors graduating today. In the rural areas, the Prime Minister continued, FPOs and SHGs are getting assistance worth lakhs of crore, storage capacity is being enhanced, more than 3 lakh common service centers have been created after 2014, more than 6 lakh kilometer optical fiber has been laid villages, more than 2.5 crore houses of the 3 crore houses under PMAY have been constructed in villages,\\xa0 more than 10 crore toilets, more than 1.5 lakh wellness centers and mechanization have increased in the agriculture sector. “All this has created massive employment opportunities”, he said. Shri Modi also touched upon growing entrepreneurship and hand-holding of small industries. He mentioned Pradhanmantri Mudra Yojna which recently completed 8 years. More than Rs 23 lakh crore worth of bank guarantee-free loans have been disbursed under the scheme and more than 70 percent of beneficiaries are women. “This scheme has created 8 crore new entrepreneurs. These are the people who have started their business for the first time with the help of Mudra Yojana,” he said. He also highlighted the power of micro-finance in energizing the economy at the grassroots level. Directing his address to those who have received their appointment letters today, the Prime Minister remarked that this is the opportunity to contribute to the development of the country while the nation moves ahead with the goal of becoming a developed India by 2047. “Today you are starting your journey as a Government Servant”, the Prime Minister continued, “In this journey, one should always remember those things which you used to feel as an ordinary citizen.” Noting the expectations of the new appointees from the government, the Prime Minister highlighted that it is now their responsibility to fulfill the expectations of others. “Each one of you will affect the life of a common man through your work in one way or the other”, he added. The Prime Minister emphasized that efforts should be made to create a positive impact on the work and improve the lives of the common man. Concluding the address, the Prime Minister urged the new appointees to not pause their learning process and said that the nature of knowing or learning something new is reflected in both work and personality. He also advised them to\\xa0 upgrade their skills by joining the online learning platform iGoT Karmayogi. Background\\nThe Rozgar Mela is a step towards the fulfillment of the commitment of the Prime Minister to accord the highest priority to employment generation.

This concept is also based on the idea of SWAGAT”\\nThe Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi addressed a programme marking 20 years of completion of the StateWide Attention on Grievances by Application of Technology - SWAGAT Initiative in Gujarat via video conferencing today. The Gujarat government is celebrating SWAGAT Saptah on successfully completing 20 years of the initiative. During the event, the Prime Minister also interacted with the past beneficiaries of the scheme. Addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister expressed satisfaction that the objective behind starting Swagat has been successfully achieved where citizens not only find solutions to their problems but also raise issues of the entire community of hundreds. “The attitude of the government should be friendly and common citizens can easily share their issues with them”, the Prime Minister said. The Prime Minister remarked that the SWAGAT initiative is completing 20 years of its existence and recalled his past experiences upon interacting with the beneficiaries. He said that it is the effort and dedication of the citizens that make SWAGAT initiative a grand success and congratulated everyone who has contributed in this direction. The Prime Minister said that the destiny of any scheme is determined by the intention and vision of that scheme when it is conceived. He recalled that when the initiative was launched in 2003 he was not very old as Chief Minister and he too faced the common refrain that power changes everyone. He said that he was clear to remain unchanged by the assumption of the chair. “I was clear that I would not become a slave of the restrictions of the chair. I will remain among people and will be there for them”, he said. This determination gave birth to StateWide Attention on Grievances by Application of Technology (SWAGAT). The Prime Minister said that the idea behind SWAGAT was to welcome the views of the common citizens in democratic institutions, be it in legislation or solutions. “SWAGAT stands by the idea of Ease of Living and Reach of Governance”, the Prime Minister said. He underlined that the good governance model of Gujarat has found its own identity in the world due to the efforts made by the government with all honesty and dedication. The Prime Minister mentioned the International Telecom Organisation which presented the prime example of good governance by SWAGAT as e-transparency and e-accountability. He also mentioned that SWAGAT drew a lot of praise from the United Nations and was also conferred the prestigious award for Public Service. The Prime Minister pointed out that Gujarat received the gold award from the Government of India for e-governance owing to SWAGAT during the Congress regime in 2011. “For me, the biggest reward is that we could serve the people of Gujarat through SWAGAT”, the Prime Minister said. In SWAGAT we prepared a practical system. The first systems of public hearings under SWAGAT were created at the block and tehsil levels. After that District Magistrate was made responsible at the district level. And at the state level, the Prime Minister informed that he took the responsibility on his own shoulders. This, he said, helped him a great deal to understand the impact and reach of the initiatives and schemes and the relations between implementing agencies and the end beneficiaries. SWAGAT empowered the citizens and gained credibility. The Prime Minister noted that even though the SWAGAT programme was held only once a week, the work related to it would be done all over the month as there were hundreds of grievances. The Prime Minister also informed that he would carry out an analysis to understand if there were any specific departments, officers or regions whose complaints were registered more often than others. “An in-depth analysis was carried out where policies were also amended if needed”, Shri Modi continued, “this created a sense of trust amongst the common citizens”. He remarked that the measure of good governance in society is dependent on the quality of the public grievance redressal system and this is the true test of democracy. The Prime Minister said that SWAGAT changed the old notion of following the established trails in government. “We proved that governance is not limited to old rules and laws but governance takes place due to innovations and new ideas”, he added. Shri Modi recalled that in 2003, e-governance was not much of a priority by the governments of the time. Paper trails and physical files led to a lot of delays and harassment video conferencing was mostly unknown. “Under these circumstances, Gujarat worked on futuristic ideas. And today, a system like SWAGAT has become the inspiration for many solutions to governance. Many states are working on this type of system. At the center we have also made a system called PRAGATI to review the working of the government. PRAGATI\\xa0 has played a big role in the rapid development of the country in the last 9 years. This concept is also based on the idea of SWAGAT.” The Prime Minister informed that he has reviewed projects worth about 16 lakh crores through PRAGATI and many projects were speeded up due to this. Concluding the address, the Prime Minister gave the analogy of a seed sprouting into a massive tree with hundreds of branches and expressed confidence that the idea of SWAGAT will give way to thousands of new innovations in governance. He expressed delight that governance initiatives are being celebrated like this as it infuses new life and energy in them. “It will continue to serve the public by becoming a model of public-oriented governance”, the Prime Minister concluded. Background\\nSWAGAT (State Wide Attention on Grievances by Application of Technology) was started by the Prime Minister in April 2003 when he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat. The programme was driven by his belief that the foremost responsibility of a Chief Minister is to solve the problems of the people of the State. With this resolve, along with the early realization of the potential of technology to promote ease of living, the then CM Modi launched a first-of-its-kind tech-based grievance redressal programme. The main purpose of this programme was to act as a bridge between the citizens and the government by using technology to solve their day-to-day grievances in a quick, efficient and time-bound manner. Over time, SWAGAT brought about a transformative impact on the lives of people and became an effective tool to solve woes in a paperless, transparent and hassle-free manner. The uniqueness of SWAGAT is that it helps the common citizen air his grievances directly to the Chief Minister. It is held on the fourth Thursday of every month wherein the Chief Minister interacts with citizens for grievance redressal. The programme has been instrumental in bridging the gap between people and government through a prompt resolution of grievances. Under the programme, it is ensured that every applicant is informed of the decision. Proceedings of all applications are available online. More than 99% of grievances submitted to date have been resolved. The SWAGAT Online Programme has four components: the State SWAGAT, District SWAGAT, Taluka SWAGAT and Gram SWAGAT. The Chief Minister himself attends public hearings during State SWAGAT. The District Collector oversees District SWAGAT while the Mamlatdar and a Class-1 Officer head the Taluka SWAGAT. In Gram SWAGAT, citizens file the application from the 1st to the 10th of every month to the Talati/Mantri. These are included in the Taluka SWAGAT program for redressal. In addition, a Lok Fariyad program is also operational for citizens wherein they file their grievances at the SWAGAT Unit. The SWAGAT Online Programme has been given various awards over the years, including the United Nations Public Service Award in 2010 for improving transparency, accountability and responsiveness in public service.

During the programme, the Prime Minister launched a mobile application ‘Assam Cop’ designed by Assam Police. The app will facilitate accused and vehicle searches from the database of the Crime & Criminal Network Tracking System (CCTNS) and the VAHAN national register. Addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister expressed happiness in getting the opportunity to become a part of the Platinum Jubilee Celebrations of Guwahati High Court. Noting that the Guwahati High Court is completing 75 years of its existence at a time when the nation is celebrating its 75th year of independence, the Prime Minister said that it is a time to preserve the experience and also take the next step to bring in answerable and responsible changes for accomplishing new goals. “Guwahati High Court has its own heritage and identity”, the Prime Minister remarked as he noted that the scope of jurisdiction of the Guwahati High Court is the largest which includes the neighboring states of Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland. Until 2013, the Prime Minister pointed out, there were seven states under the jurisdiction of the Guwahati High Court as he highlighted the rich history and democratic heritage of the entire Northeast associated with it. The Prime Minister congratulated the state of Assam along with the entire Northeastern states, especially the legal fraternity on the momentous occasion. Noting the importance of the Jayanti of Babasaheb today, the Prime Minister paid tribute to Dr Ambedakar. He said that the constitutional values of equality and cohesion are the foundation of modern India. The Prime Minister recalled his detailed exposition about the aspirational society of India from the rampart of Red Fort on the last Independence Day. The Prime Minister noted that the aspirations of Indian citizens in the 21st century are unbounded and the Judiciary as a pillar of democracy has a strong and sensitive role to play in meeting these aspirations. The Constitution also expects us to build a strong, vibrant and modern legal system. Underlining the combined responsibility of the Legislature, Judiciary and Executive, the Prime Minister gave the example of the abolition of outdated laws. “We repealed thousands of archaic laws, reduced compliances”, he said. He informed that about 2000 such laws and more than 40 thousand compliances have been discontinued. This along with the decriminalization of many provisions of business has reduced the number of cases in the courts. “Be it the government or the judiciary, the role of every institution and its constitutional obligation is connected to the Ease of Living of the common citizens”, the Prime Minister remarked. Highlighting that technology has emerged as a powerful tool in achieving Ease of Living, the Prime Minister said that the government is ensuring absolute utilization of technology in every possible sector. Giving examples of DBT, Aadhaar and Digital India Mission, the Prime Minister said that every scheme has become a medium of ensuring the rights of the poor. Touching upon PM Swamitva Yojna, the Prime Minister highlighted that India has taken a huge lead when dealing with the issue of property rights which resulted in the burdening of the legal system of the country. He pointed out that even developed nations are dealing with the issue of unclear property rights. He informed that drone mapping of more than 1 lakh villages in the country and property card distribution to lakhs of citizens have already been accomplished, which will result in a decline in property-related cases and ease the lives of citizens. The Prime Minister felt that there is unlimited scope for technology to modernize the justice delivery system in the country. Praising the work of the Supreme Court’s e-committee, the Prime Minister told the gathering about phase 3 of the e-court mission as announced in this year's budget. He also mentioned global efforts to use AI in the judicial system to bring efficiency. “We should also try to increase efforts to improve the ease of justice for the common citizen through AI”, the Prime Minister said. Talking about the Alternative Dispute Resolution System, the Prime Minister touched upon the rich local traditional alternative dispute resolution mechanism of the Northeast. He also praised the publication of 6 books by the High Court on customary laws. He also requested that these traditions should be taught in law schools. The Prime Minister said that a critical part of ease of justice is correct knowledge and understanding among the citizens about the laws of the country as it enhances citizen trust in the country and its systems. Shri Modi informed about the efforts to create a more accessible simple version of all the laws. “Effort is to draft laws in simple language and this approach will be greatly helpful for the courts of our country”,\\xa0 he said. The Prime Minister also mentioned the BHASHINI portal which aims to help every citizen to access the Internet in their own language. He said that the courts also benefit from this. The Prime Minister emphasized the need for the government and the judiciary to be sensitive towards those who have been incarcerated for petty crimes for years and do not have the resources or the money. He also took note of those whose families were not ready to accept them after the legal processes had been completed. The Prime Minister informed that this year’s Budget has a provision for financial assistance for such prisoners where financial aid will be handed over to the state by the center to help them in their release. “Dharma protects those who protect the Dharma”, the Prime Minister said quoting a shloka, and underlined that it is our ‘dharma’ and our responsibility as an institution that the work towards the nation remains foremost. The Prime Minister concluded by underlining that it is this belief that will take the country to the goal of ‘Viksit Bharat’. Governor of Assam, Shri Gulab Chand Kataria, Chief Minister of Assam, Shri Himanta Biswa Sarma, Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh, Shri Pema Khandu, Union Minister for Law and Justice, Shri Kiren Rijiju, Justice Hrishikesh Roy of Supreme Court, and Chief Justice Sandeep Mehta of Guwahati High Court were present on the occasion among others. Background\\nThe Guwahati High Court was established in 1948 and it served as the common court for the seven north-eastern states of Assam, Nagaland, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh until March 2013, when separate High Courts for the States of Manipur, Meghalaya and Tripura were created. The Gauhati High Court now has jurisdiction over the States of Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh, with its Principal Seat at Guwahati and three permanent Benches in Kohima (Nagaland), Aizawl (Mizoram) and Itanagar (Arunachal Pradesh).

India lives in its quest for the eternal”“Our temples and pilgrimages have been symbols of the values and prosperity of our society for centuries”\\nThe Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, addressed a programme of Sree Seetharama Swamy Temple in Thrissur via video message, today. He greeted everyone on the auspicious occasion of Thrissur Pooram Festival. The Prime Minister started by acknowledging Thrissur’s status as the cultural capital of Kerala where culture, tradition and arts thrive along with spirituality, philosophy and festivals. The Prime Minister expressed happiness that Thrissur is keeping its heritage and identity alive and Sree Seetharama Swamy Temple is working as a vibrant center in this direction. The Prime Minister conveyed his happiness on expansion of the temple and noted that a gold plated Garbha Grih is being dedicated to Lord\\xa0Sree Seetharama and Lord Ayyappa and Lord Shiva. He also praised the installation of 55 feet Lord Hanuman statue and greeted everyone for Kumbhabhishekam. Lauding the contribution of the Kalyan family and Shri T S Kalyanraman and recalling his earlier meeting and discussion about the temple, the Prime Minister expressed the feeling of spiritual joy that he was feeling on the occasion. The Prime Minister remarked that Thrissur and Sree Seetharama Swamy Temple are not only the pinnacle of faith, they are also the reflection of the consciousness and soul of India. Shri Modi recalled the period of invasion during the medieval period. As these invaders were destroying the temples, the Prime Minister said, they were oblivious that though India is visible in the symbols but it lives in its knowledge and thought. India lives in its quest for the eternal, he added. “India’s soul has been proclaiming its immortality in the form of\\xa0 Sree Seetharama Swamy and Bhagwan Ayyappa. “These temples from those times\\xa0 declare that the idea of \\u200b\\u200b'Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat' is an immortal idea of \\u200b\\u200bthousands of years. Today, in the golden age of independence, we are taking this idea forward by taking a pledge to be proud of our heritage”, he said. “Our temples and pilgrimages have been symbols of the values and prosperity of our society for centuries”, the Prime Minister said as he expressed delight that Sree Seetharama Swamy Temple is preserving the grandeur and splendor of ancient India. Highlighting the many public welfare programs that are run through this temple, the Prime Minister said that a system is in place where the resources received from the society are returned as service. He urged the temple committee to add more resolutions of the country to these efforts, be it Shri Anna Abhiyan, Swachhta Abhiyan or public awareness towards natural farming. Concluding the address, the Prime Minister expressed belief that the blessings of Shri\\xa0 Sree Seetharama Swamy ji will be showered upon everyone as the work to realize the goals and resolutions of the country continues.

India launched the world's largest, most successful vaccination drive”“This journey of transformation is as contemporary as it is futuristic”“Attack on corruption will continue”\\nThe Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi addressed the Republic Summit at Hotel at Taj Palace in New Delhi today. Addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister expressed gratitude for being a part of the Republic Summit and congratulated the entire team for the completion of 6 years next month. Recalling his participation in the Republic Summit in 2019 with the theme ‘India’s Moment’, the Prime Minister said that it had the background of the people’s mandate when the citizens had elected a government with an overwhelming majority and stability for the second time in a row. “The country realized that India’s moment is now here”, the Prime Minister said. Throwing light on this year’s theme ‘Time of Transformation’, the Prime Minister said that citizens can now witness the transformation on the ground which was envisioned 4 years earlier. The Prime Minister said that the standard of measuring the direction of the country is the speed of its development. He said that it took the Indian economy 60 years to reach the 1 trillion mark and we had reached 2 trillion with great difficulty in 2014, meaning a 2 trillion economy in 7 decades and today, after just 9 years India is almost a three and half trillion economy. And, India jumped from 10th rank to 5th rank in the last 9 years, that too amidst the once-in-a-century pandemic, he said. When other economies are struggling, India not only overcame the crisis but is growing fast, he added. Talking about the dynamics of the impact of politics, the Prime Minister said that the first order impact is the first goal of any policy and it is visible in a very short time. However, every policy has a second or third impact also which is deeper but takes time to be visible. The Prime Minister said that the policies adopted in the aftermath of Independence led to a situation where the government became the controller and competition was killed and private industry and MSME were not allowed to grow. First order impact of these policies was extreme backwardness and the second order impact was even more harmful i.e. India’s consumption growth contracted compared to the world. Manufacturing sector weakened and we lost many opportunities for investment. The third order impact of these, Shri Modi continued, was the absence of innovation ecosystem in India leading to fewer innovative enterprises and fewer jobs. The youth stayed dependent on government jobs alone and brain drain happened. The Prime Minister informed that the policies made after 2014 by the present government paid attention to second and third order effects apart from initial benefits. He stated that the number of houses handed out to people under PM Awas Yojna increased to more than 3.75 crores from 1.5 crores in the last 4 years where the ownership of these houses belongs to the women. He expressed satisfaction that crores of poor women have now become ‘Lakhpati Didi’ as the cost of construction of the houses is several lakhs. The Prime Minister also drew attention to the fact the scheme created numerous employment opportunities. “PM Awas Yojna has taken the self-confidence of the poor and marginalized to new heights”, the Prime Minister said. Speaking about Mudra Yojna which provides financial support to micro and small entrepreneurs, the Prime Minister informed that the scheme has completed 8 years a while ago. He informed that more than 40 crore loans were disbursed under the Mudra Yojna where 70 percent of the beneficiaries were women. The first impact of this scheme, the Prime Minister said, was the increase in employment and self-employment opportunities. He underlined that a societal change can be witnessed be it by opening Jan Dhan accounts for women or incentivizing self-help groups where the decision-making authority of the women in the family has been established. He further added that the women of the country are strengthening the economy of the country by becoming job creators. The Prime Minister also elaborated on the first, second and third order impact in the PM Svamitva scheme. Property cards made through the use of technology gave confidence in property security. Another impact is the expansion of the drone sector through increased demand. Also, Property cards have decreased the cases of property disputes and reduced the stress on the police and justice system. Furthermore, property with papers has enabled help from banks in the villages. The Prime Minister touched upon schemes like DBT, electricity and water facilities that have brought a revolution on the ground level. “It is for the first time in the country that the poor have got security as well as dignity”, Shri Modi remarked. He underlined that those who were once considered a burden are now steering the path of development in the country. “These schemes have now become the basis for Viksit Bharat”, he added. Shri Modi said that in the last 9 years dalits, deprived, tribals, women, poor, women, middle class everyone is experiencing a change. The country is witnessing systematic work in mission mode. “We changed the mindset of power to the mindset of service, we made welfare of the poor our medium. We made ‘santushtikaran’ instead of ‘tushtikaran’ as our base. This approach has created a defence shield for the middle class” he said. He touched upon the savings induced by schemes like Ayushman Yojna, affordable medicine, free vaccination, free dialysis, and accident insurance for crores of families. Touching upon PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojna, the Prime Minister said that it is another protective shield for a huge populace that did not let any family sleep on an empty stomach during the testing times of the Corona pandemic. He informed that the government is spending 4 lakh crore rupees on this Anna Yojna scheme, be it on One Nation One Ration Card or JAM Trinity. He underlined that social justice in the true sense is when the poor get their deserved share from the government. According to a recent working paper from the IMF, the Prime Minister said, extreme poverty is on the verge of elimination due to such policies, even during the Corona period. Talking about MNREGA, the Prime Minister mentioned various irregularities and the absence of any permanent asset development before 2014. Now, he said, there is transparency by sending the money directly into the account and creating resources in the villages like houses, canals, ponds, baodis etc. “Most of the payments are cleared in 15 days now and more than 90 percent of labourers' Aadhar cards have been linked, leading to a reduction in job card scams leading to prevention of pilferage of about 40 thousand crore rupees,” he said. “This journey of transformation is as contemporary as it is futuristic”, the Prime Minister remarked as he highlighted that preparations are already underway for many decades. The Prime Minister recalled the time when new technology would arrive years or decades later. He said that India has broken this trend in the last 9 years and underlined the steps taken to achieve this. He mentioned freeing technology-related sectors from the control of the government, insisting on developing technology in India according to the needs of the country, and lastly, adopting a mission-mode approach to research and development for the technology of the future. He gave the example of 5G technology and said that the speed shown by India in its development is being discussed all over the world. The Prime Minister recalled the Corona pandemic and underlined that India chose the path of ‘atmanirbharta’ or self-reliance even in times of crisis. The Prime Minister highlighted the indigenously made effective vaccines that were produced in a very short time, and the world's largest, most successful vaccine campaign. The Prime Minister looked back to the time and said, “This was also when some people were rejecting Made in India vaccines and advocating for the import of foreign vaccines.”\\nThe Prime Minister said that despite various obstacles and attempts to derail it, the Digital India campaign is being talked about everywhere. He also recalled attempts to stop JAM Trinity and pseudo-intellectuals mocking digital payment. Today, India is witnessing the most number of Digital payments, he said. Dwelling upon the displeasure against himself from his critics, the Prime Minister said that the reason behind the discourse is permanently cutting off the sources of black money for these people and there is no half-hearted, isolated approach in the fight against corruption. “Now, there is an integrated, institutionalized approach. This is our commitment”, the Prime Minister said. He pointed out that about 10 crore fake beneficiaries of government schemes have been rooted out because of JAM Trinity, which is more than the total population of Delhi, Punjab and Haryana. He further added that the situation could have been worse if the present government had not removed these 10 crore fake names from the system. He mentioned the various steps taken to achieve this and mentioned giving constitutional status to Aadhaar and opening more than 45 crore Jan Dhan bank accounts. The Prime Minister informed that Rs 28 lakh crore have been transferred to crores of beneficiaries through DBT so far. “DBT means no commission, no leakage. Due to this one arrangement, transparency has come in dozens of schemes and programmes”, Shri Modi added. Similarly, he continued, government procurement too was a big source of corruption in the country. Now the GeM portal has transformed it. Faceless taxation and GST have blocked corrupt practices. “When such honesty prevails, it is natural for the corrupt to feel discomfort and they plan to destroy the honest system. This would have perhaps succeeded if it was against Modi alone, but they know that they are facing common citizens. “No matter how big an alliance these corrupt people cobble, the attack on corruption will continue,” said the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister concluded by saying “This Amrit Kaal is of ‘Sabka Prayas’, When hard work and might of every Indian will be applied, we will be able to realize the dream of a ‘Viksit Bharat ‘ soon.

The Prime Minister acknowledged his personal connection with the theme and expressed happiness that it is becoming\\xa0 a global movement. Quoting Chanakya, the Prime Minister underlined the importance of the small deeds and said “by itself, each good deed for the planet may seem insignificant. But when\\xa0 billions across the world do it together, the impact is huge. We believe that individuals making the right decisions for our planet\\xa0 are key in the battle\\xa0 for our planet. This is\\xa0 the core of Mission LiFE.”\\nTalking about the genesis of the LiFE movement the Prime Minister remembered that in 2015 at the United Nations General Assembly he spoke\\xa0 about the need\\xa0 for behavioural\\xa0 change and in October 2022, the UN Secretary General and he launched\\xa0 Mission LiFE. He mentioned that the preamble to the outcome document of CoP-27 also speaks about sustainable lifestyle and consumption. If people understand that it is not just the government but they too can contribute, the Prime Minister pointed out that “their anxiety will turn into action.”\\xa0 He elaborated “climate change cannot be fought from conference tables alone. It has to be fought\\xa0 from the dinner tables in every home. When an idea moves from discussion tables\\xa0 to dinner tables,\\xa0 it becomes\\xa0 a mass movement. Making every family and every individual\\xa0 aware that their choices\\xa0 can help the planet\\xa0 can provide\\xa0 scale and speed. Mission LiFE\\xa0 is about democratising the battle against climate change. When people\\xa0 become conscious that simple acts\\xa0 in their daily lives are powerful,\\xa0 there will be a very positive impact\\xa0 on the environment.”\\nShri Modi illustrated his thinking with examples from India and said “in this matter of mass movements and behaviour transformation,\\xa0 the people of India\\xa0 have done\\xa0 a lot\\xa0 in the last few years.” . He gave examples of improved sex ratio, massive cleanliness drive, adoption of LED bulbs which helps in avoiding\\xa0 nearly 39 million tonnes\\xa0 of Carbon Dioxide emissions\\xa0 every year. Saving water by coverage of\\xa0 nearly seven hundred thousand hectares of farmland\\xa0 by micro-irrigation. Shri Modi informed that under Mission LIFE, the government’s efforts are spread across\\xa0 many domains such as making local bodies environment-friendly, saving water, saving energy, reducing waste and e-waste, adopting healthy lifestyles, adoption of natural farming, promotion of millets. These efforts, he said, will save over twenty two billion units\\xa0 of energy, save nine trillion litres of water, reduce waste by three hundred and seventy five million tons, recycle almost one million tons of\\xa0 e-waste and generate\\xa0 around one hundred and seventy million dollars\\xa0 of additional cost savings\\xa0 by 2030. “Further, it will help us\\xa0 reduce the wastage\\xa0 of fifteen billion tons of food. Let me give you\\xa0 a comparison\\xa0 to know how big this is. The global primary crop production\\xa0 in 2020\\xa0 according to FAO\\xa0 was about nine billion tons”, he elaborated. Prime Minister Modi emphasized that global institutions\\xa0 have an important role\\xa0 to play\\xa0 in encouraging countries\\xa0 across the world. Referring to the World Bank Group’s\\xa0 proposed increase in climate finance from 26% to 35%, as a share of\\xa0 total financing, he said that the focus\\xa0 of this climate finance is usually on\\xa0 conventional aspects. “Adequate financing methods\\xa0 need to be worked out\\xa0 for behavioural\\xa0 initiatives too.

You also have to decide short-term, medium-term and long-term goals”“Projects worth more than 400 crores related to sports infrastructure are giving a new direction to the development of the Northeast today”\\nThe Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi addressed the ‘Chintan Shivir’ of Ministers of Youth Affairs & Sports of States/UTs in Imphal, Manipur today via video message. Addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister expressed delight that ‘Chintan Shivir’ is taking place in Manipur this year and many sportspersons from the Northeast have raised the glory of the Tricolour by winning medals for the country. The Prime Minister highlighted the indigenous games of the region such as Sagol Kangjai, Thang-ta, Yubi Lakpi, Mukna and Hiang Tannaba, and said that they are very attractive in their own right. “Northeast and Manipur have significantly contributed to taking forward the sports tradition of the country”, Shri Modi added. Further explaining the indigenous games, the Prime Minister mentioned Oo-Lawabi of Manipur which resembles Kabaddi, Hiyang Tannaba reminds one of Kerala's boat race. He also noted Manipur’s historical association with polo and said that the Northeast adds new colours to the country's cultural diversity and provides new dimensions to the country's sports diversity. The Prime Minister expressed confidence that Sports Ministers from all over the country will have a learning experience at the end of the ‘Chintan Shivir’. “Any Chintan Shivir begins with contemplation, proceeds with rumination and ends with implementation”, the Prime Minister remarked, throwing light on the Chintan Shivir and underlined the need to discuss future goals and also review the previous conferences. Recalling the previous meeting in Kevadiya in 2022, the Prime Minister pointed out that many important issues were discussed and an agreement was reached to make a road map for an ecosystem for the betterment of sports. The Prime Minister touched upon increasing the participation between the center and the states in the sports sector and highlighted the strides that have been made possible. He further added that this review should not be carried out at the level of policies and programs but on infrastructure development and sports achievements of the previous year. Highlighting the performance of Indian athletes and sportspersons in the last year, the Prime Minister lauded their phenomenal efforts, especially in international sports events. He stressed on further extending help to the players while celebrating these achievements. The Prime Minister pointed out that the preparations of the Sports Ministry and its departments will be tested in events like Squash World Cup, Hockey Asian Champions Trophy, and Asian Youth & Junior Weightlifting Championship in the times to come and stressed that while players are preparing themselves, it is now time for the ministries to work with a different approach regarding sports tournaments. Drawing the analogy of man-to-man marking in sports like football and hockey, the Prime Minister emphasized the need to carry out different strategies for each tournament and follow the approach of match-to-match marking. “You have to focus on sports infrastructure, and sports training according to each tournament. You also have to decide short-term, medium-term and long-term goals”, the Prime Minister said. The Prime Minister said that fitness could be achieved by a player alone but it is the continuity that makes way for great performance. He underlined the need to play more competitions and sports tournaments at the local level so that players get to learn a lot from this. Shri Modi asked the Sports Ministers to ensure no sporting talent is overlooked. The Prime Minister underlined that it is the responsibility of the government to provide quality sports infrastructure to every talented player in the country and emphasized the need for the central and state governments to work together. Touching upon Khelo India Scheme, the Prime Minister noted that it has definitely improved sports infrastructure at the district level and urged to take the improvements to the block level. He also stated that the participation of all the stakeholders including the private sector is important. The Prime Minister also suggested that National Youth Festival be rethought to make it more effective and said that such programs which are held in the states should not become just a formality. “India will be able to establish itself as a leading sports country only when such efforts are made all-round”, the Prime Minister said. Highlighting the sporting developments carried out in the Northeast, the Prime Minister said that the region is a huge inspiration for the nation. He informed that projects worth more than 400 crores related to sports infrastructure are giving a new direction to the development of the Northeast today. The Prime Minister gave examples of the National Sports University of Imphal which will provide new opportunities to the youth of the country in the coming times, and efforts like Khelo India Scheme and TOPS that have played a big role in this. Informing that at least 2 Khelo India Centers in every district of the Northeast, and Khelo India State Center of Excellence in every State are being set up, the Prime Minister said that these efforts would become the foundation of a new India in the sports world and will give a new identity to the country. Concluding the address, Shri Modi urged the stakeholder to speed up such works in the respective states and expressed confidence that the Chintan Shivir will play an important role in this direction. Background\\nMore than 100 invitees from various States, Union Territories and the Ministry of Youth Affairs are expected to attend the unique two-day Chintan Shivir and put forward their views and ideas on making the nation fitter and making India into one of the biggest sporting powers in the world. Also, discussions will be held for working towards the objectives of personality-building and nation-building, that is, developing the personality of youth by involving them in various nation-building activities.
