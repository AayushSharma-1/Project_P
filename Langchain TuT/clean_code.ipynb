Currently ECI has social media presence on major platforms including Facebook, Instagram, X, YouTube with recent additions of Public App, WhatsApp Channel, and LinkedIn. ‘Turning 18’ Campaign\\nThe Commission has on various occasions identified urban apathy and youth apathy as a cause for concern in its quest to improve voter turnout. ECI campaign ‘Turning 18,’ in the run-up to the 18th Lok Sabha Elections, specifically targets young and first-time voters. The primary objective is to galvanize youngsters to participate in the upcoming elections and address the critical issues of urban and youth apathy noticed in previous elections. The ‘Turning 18’ campaign employs various compelling themes and strategies to capture the attention of its audience. The strategy involves branding of individual series with thematic logos for easy identification and association. Additionally, the campaign portrays a comparison of past and recent elections, as ‘then vs. now’ to underscore the progress made over time. By emphasizing the significance of voting immediately upon turning 18, the campaign seeks to inspire a sense of civic responsibility among young voters. Furthermore, infographics, highlighting the growing participation of the women electorate, especially in the age bracket of 18-30 showcases the inclusivity of India's democratic process. The impact of the ‘Turning 18’ campaign is substantial, with widespread amplification facilitated by State Chief Electoral Officers (CEOs) and the national public broadcaster, DD News and Akashvani. Moreover, ECI has collaborated with its popular network of National and State SVEEP icons to have a multiplier effect. This concerted effort helps disseminate the campaign's message across diverse segments of society, effectively reaching its target audience and generating significant momentum for the forthcoming poll days. ‘You are the One’ Campaign\\nBuilding on ‘Turning 18’ campaign, ECI launched another impactful campaign titled ‘You Are The One.’ This initiative aims to recognize and celebrate the invaluable contributions of various stakeholders involved in the electoral process.

Through Polls and Pixels series, ECI shares a visual journey of Indian Elections since inception. ‘VerifyBeforeYouAmplify’ initiative\\n\\nIn response to the proliferation of fake news and misinformation online, the ECI introduced the ‘Verify Before You Amplify’ initiative (पोस्ट से पहले पुष्टि) as highlighted by CEC Shri Rajiv Kumar during the Press Conference for announcement of Schedule of General Elections, thereby busting fake news and urging individuals to exercise caution and diligence before sharing information on social media platforms. This proactive measure aims to empower citizens to verify the accuracy and authenticity of content before amplifying it, thereby\\nmitigating the spread of false information and safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process. Additionally, information on schedule, IT Applications and other critical aspects including decisions of the Commission, how to check name in Electoral Roll and find polling stations etc. is shared graphically and with reels for precise and sorted information for users. It is also worthwhile to note that the conduct of ECI Press Conference has also seen a paradigm shift with CEC Shri Rajiv Kumar addressing the Press Conference with a lively and impactful presentation which gets live streamed and live tweeted for instant reach to stakeholders including media.

By extending this optional facility to these segments of the voters, the Election Commission recognizes the need to ensure that citizens’ right to vote is not encumbered by physical barriers and disabilities. This upholds the Commission’s motto of ensuring - No voter is left behind. The procedure to avail this facility is simple yet thorough. Within five days of the election notification, eligible voters must complete Form 12D and submit it to the returning officer. PwD voters submit a baseline disability certificate with their applications. Booth Level Officer (BLO) is responsible for retrieving Form 12D from the elector's place of residence when the required documentation has been completed. Candidates receive a list of these electors in order to maintain accountability and transparency; if they wish, they can choose a representative to supervise the process. Following this, a dedicated team of polling officials along with security officials visits the voter's residence to collect their votes. Crucially, voters are notified ahead of time of the planned visit, allowing them to be prepared to exercise their right to vote in a safe and comfortable manner. To further expedite the procedure and improve accessibility, voters can also receive notifications via SMS about the days when their home voting facility will be active. The complete process is videographed for transparency. This initiative underscores the ECI's dedication to leveraging technology to enhance the electoral process. From digital notifications to the deployment of videographers, the incorporation of innovative solutions facilitates a seamless and transparent voting experience for eligible individuals.

In a day long ‘Conference on Low Voter Turnout’ held today at Nirvachan Sadan, New Delhi, Municipal Commissioners from major cities and select District Election Officers (DEOs) from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh deliberated together to chart a path towards enhancing voter engagement and participation in identified urban and rural PCs. The Conference was chaired by Chief Election Commissioner Shri Rajiv Kumar along with Election Commissioners Shri Gyanesh Kumar and Shri Sukhbir Singh Sandhu. On the occasion, a booklet on voter apathy was released by the Commission. 11 States/UTs namely Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, NCT of Delhi, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Telangana, Gujarat, Punjab, Rajasthan, J&K and Jharkhand had a voter turnout lower than the national average of 67.40% in the 2019 General Elections to the Lok Sabha. Out of the total 50 Rural PCs across 11 states identified with lower voter turnout than the national average in 2019, 40 PCs are from Uttar Pradesh (22 PCs) and Bihar (18PCs). In UP, 51- Phulpur PC recorded the lowest turnout of 48.7%, while in Bihar, 29-Nalanda PC recorded lowest turnout of 48.79%. While addressing the Municipal Commissioners and DEOs, CEC Shri Rajiv Kumar said that a total of 266 Parliamentary Constituencies (215 Rural & 51 Urban) with low voter turnout have been identified and all concerned Municipal Commissioners, DEOs and State CEOs have been called today to find ways to reach out to voters in targeted manner. He emphasized on a three pronged strategy of providing facilitation at polling stations like queue management, shelter parking in congested areas; targeted outreach & communication; and involvement of critical stakeholders like RWAs, local icons and youth influencers to persuade people to come to polling stations. CEC Kumar directed them to prepare a booth wise action plan for enhanced participation and behaviour change. He asked all MCs and DEOs to prepare different strategies for urban and rural areas and plan interventions accordingly for different target audiences. He emphasized that the “One size fits all” approach will not yield results. CEC Kumar also urged the authorities to act in a manner that instils pride among the voters in participating in the democratic festivities. He called for a movement in which people are self-motivated to vote. The conference, a collaborative effort between the ECI and key stakeholders, focused on crafting a comprehensive action plan to address voter apathy, streamline logistical operations, and increase voter turnout. Discussions were centred on critical issues such as optimizing queue management at polling stations, facilitating voting in high-rise buildings, and leveraging the influential Systematic Voters' Education and Electoral Participation (SVEEP) programme. With a keen emphasis on partnership and inclusivity, the ECI urged Municipal Commissioners and DEOs to actively contribute to the initiative. Urban specific hurdles to increased voter turnout were identified and targeted city specific interventions were planned and the officers were encouraged to develop tailored, region-specific outreach programs that resonate with the unique needs and demographics of their constituencies. In line with this vision, the ECI outlined an array of innovative voter awareness campaigns under SVEEP, including:\\n\\nThe Conference was attended by Municipal Commissioners of Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Pune, Thane, Nagpur, Patna Sahib, Lucknow and Kanpur as well as select District Election Officers of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. CEO Bihar, CEO Uttar Pradesh, CEO Maharashtra and CEO Delhi also attended the conference with CEOs of 7 states namely Karnataka, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Punjab joined virtually. Background:\\nApproximately 297 million eligible voters did not vote in the General Elections to Lok Sabha in 2019 underscoring the scale of the problem which calls for proactive measures. Furthermore, recent elections across various states have highlighted trends of urban apathy towards the electoral process, warranting targeted interventions and collaborative endeavours. Of the 50 PCs with the lowest voter turnout in the 2019 GE to Lok Sabha, 17 were found to be in Metropolitans or major cities reflecting an unfortunate trend of urban apathy. The same trend has been seen in the past few State Assembly Elections. In General Gujarat State Legislative Assembly elections 2022, Gandhidham AC in Kachchh district, which has industrial establishments, recorded lowest polling percentage of 48.14%, a sharp decline of almost 6% than the last election in 2017, recording a new low. Similarly, in GE to SLA of Himachal Pradesh 2022, the Shimla AC in Shimla District (State Capital) recorded the lowest polling percentage of 63.48% against the State Average Poll % of 75.78%. It has been observed that all rural Assembly Constituencies have voted more in percentage terms than urban Assembly Constituencies of Surat. The difference in lowest urban AC of Surat with highest rural AC is as much as 25%. Similarly, in the State Legislative Assembly Election of Karnataka 2023, AC Bommanahalli in Bangalore (Bangalore South) recorded the lowest VTR of 47.5% as compared to State Average VTR of 73.84%.

Additionally, for the migrants residing outside Jammu and Udhampur (who will continue to submit Form M), ECI has authorized the self-attestation of the certificate appended with Form-M, thus removing the hassle of getting this certificate attested by the Gazetted Officer. The decision was taken by the Commission after a meeting today chaired by CEC Shri Rajiv Kumar along with Election Commissioners Shri Gyanesh Kumar and Dr. Sukhbir Singh Sandhu. Various representations were received from several Kashmiri Migrant groups projecting the difficulties they face in filling of Form-M every election which brings a lot of hassle to them in exercising their right to franchise. The Form-M procedure subjects these voters to additional bureaucratic hurdles compared to other voters and also the process of filling out the Form-M is often complex and cumbersome, requiring specific documentation, proof of migration status and attestation by a gazetted officer. The Chief Electoral Officer, Jammu and Kashmir also submitted his comments to the Commission on 09.04.2024 with due consultation and in full agreement with the political parties. The Commission after taking into consideration the representations received from several Kashmiri Migrant groups regarding the scheme, feedback from the political parties and comments of the Chief Electoral Officer, UT of Jammu and Kashmir, notified the Scheme for Kashmiri migrants to vote in person at transitory camps and voting by means of postal ballot pertaining to the ongoing General Election to Lok Sabha, 2024, vide order No. 3/J&K-HP/2024(NS-I) dated 11.04.2024.

Enforcement Agencies have made a record seizure of over Rs. 4650 crores in ECI’s resolute fight against money power even before the first phase of polling for the 18th Lok Sabha elections commences on Friday. This marks a sharp increase over Rs 3475 crores seized during the entire Lok Sabha election in 2019. Significantly, 45% of the seizures are of drugs and narcotics, that are under the special focus of the Commission. The seizures have been possible by comprehensive planning, scaled up collaboration and unified deterrence action from agencies, proactive citizen participation and optimal engagement of technology. Use of black money, over and above political financing and accurate disclosure thereof, may disturb the level playing field in favour of more resourceful party or candidate in specific geographies. The seizures are a critical part of ECI resolve to conduct the Lok Sabha elections free of inducements and electoral malpractices and to ensure a level playing field. CEC Shri Rajiv Kumar, while announcing the polls last month, underlined Money Power as one of the ‘4M’ challenges. On 12th April, Commission led by CEC Shri Rajiv Kumar along with ECs Shri Gyanesh Kumar and Shri Sukhbir Singh Sandhu reviewed all Central Observers deployed in Phase -1 of elections going to poll on 19th April. Tightening, monitoring and checking were amongst the focus of deliberations to ensure inducement-free electoral process. The enhanced seizures reflect ECI’s unwavering commitment to monitor inducements and curb electoral malpractices for a ‘level playing field’, particularly in favour of smaller and less resourceful parties. In an incident in Nilgiris, Tamil Nadu, the Commission suspended the flying squad team leader for laxity in duty and selective checking of a cavalcade of a prominent leader. Similarly, officials checked vehicles in the convoy of CM of a state and also vehicle of a Dy CM in another state. Commission has also taken strict action against approximately 106 government servants who have been found assisting politicians in campaigning, thereby violating the Code of Conduct and instructions. In the press briefing during announcement of Parliamentary elections, CEC Shri Rajiv Kumar stressed in his presentation on strict compliance of BCAS instructions on surveillance and inspection of non-scheduled aircrafts and helicopters by Income tax, airport authorities and SPs of concerned districts, border agencies to keep close watch on international checkposts and GST authorities to closely monitor godowns, especially makeshift godowns meant for storing freebies. The Commission during reviews had always emphasized that there will be multi-pronged surveillance on all modes of transport - check posts and nakas for road transport, Coast guard for coastal routes and DMs and SPs alongside agencies for air routes including checking of helicopters and non-scheduled flights. Details of State /UT wise and category wise seizures as on 13.04.2024 is placed at Annexure A. How has it been made possible? The portal facilitates digital trails and availability of seizure information at the click of a mouse enabling quick and timely reviews at all controlling levels. As per data, 6398 District nodal officers of various agencies, 734 state nodal officers, 59000 flying squads (FS) and Statics Surveillance Teams (SST) have been on boarded on ESMS platform for exhaustive real time monitoring and updates. All nodal officials have been trained on various aspects of using ESMS. The system took firm root during Assembly elections during 2023, when Rs 2014.26 crores was seized as against Rs 239.35 crores in the previous corresponding elections. With successful implementation and feedback from the field in the last round of assembly elections, it has been reviewed and made robust before implementation in ongoing elections. S.'),\n",

The workshop was chaired by Additional Secretary (Logistics), DPIIT, Shri Rajeev Singh Thakur, aimed to sensitise the Economic/User Ministries/ Departments about onboarding of GIS Data Layers on the PM GatiShakti NMP, benefits of using the platform for planning and to review the progress made in this respect. Additional Secretary, DPIIT, Shri Rajeev Singh Thakur, highlighted PM GatiShakti principles to be adopted for integrated planning and holistic development of socio-economic infrastructure. He further emphasized PMGS-NMP as a comprehensive and sustainable strategy to reshape India’s infrastructure, by fostering integrated planning and harmonised project implementation involving all relevant Ministries and State Governments. This “whole-of-the-government” approach is embraced to enhance decision-making in project planning as well as ‘ease of doing’ and ‘ease of living’. Joint Secretary, DPIIT, Dr. Surendra Kumar Ahirwar, mentioned that adoption of PM GatiShakti NMP by economic Ministries is important not only for efficient data driven planning of its own infra/schemes but also for planning of infra/schemes by infra/social Ministries as well as States/UTs. Joint Secretary, DPIIT, Shri E Srinivas, stated integration of Economic/User Ministries on the PMGS-NMP will ensure the efficient realisation of the core principles of GatiShakti—logistical efficiency, multimodality, and connectivity to economic hubs. The workshop witnessed enthusiastic participation from over 32 officials representing 18 ministries/departments, including Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, Chemicals & Petrochemicals, Fertilisers, Coal, Commerce, Food & Public Distribution, Defence Production, Electronics & Information Technology, Economic Affairs, Revenue, Animal Husbandry & Dairying, Fisheries, Food Processing Industries, Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises, Mines, Steel, Earth Sciences, and Pharmaceuticals. More than 20 officials from BISAG-N and Logistics Division, DPIIT were also present. The event commenced with a thought-provoking video on PM GatiShakti, followed by a comprehensive presentation by the Logistics Division, DPIIT, highlighting the overview, progress, benefits, and the way forward for the ambitious program. BISAG-N, the technical partner, provided an insightful presentation on the technical architecture of PMGS-NMP and tools developed for various ministries enabling participants to gain a practical understanding of its features. The core segment of the workshop involved presentations from the economic/user ministries/departments, showcasing their status of adoption of PM GatiShakti and the necessary steps taken in line with the provided pointers. This interactive session facilitated an exchange of best practices, challenges faced, and potential solutions, fostering a collaborative approach towards seamless implementation, leading to a conclusion that the Ministries/Departments should proactively identify and upload various data layers on the PMGS-NMP, develop Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for data management, and enhance capacity to independently plan projects and programs utilising PMGS-NMP and develop specific Planning Tools. As a way forward, specific action points were highlighted, involving identification of\\xa0 interventions followed by analysis, leading to accelerated adoption of PM GatiShakti principles in planning of socio-economic infrastructures. The use of the PMGS-NMP platform has generated successful use cases in the infrastructure sector such as urban transport, roadways, railways, etc., along with benefits to users. The use of PMGS-NMP has significantly de-risked infrastructure investments for the private sector, streamlined operations and decision-making for Ministries/Departments and States/UTs. The GatiShakti approach is also helping to plan disaster management, location of social sector assets, development of tourism circuits, etc., in a manner to give maximum connectivity for the users. Recognizing the significant progress made by Infrastructure and Social sector Ministries, the workshop focused on enabling Economic/User Ministries to effectively leverage the PMGS-NMP platform. ***\\nAD/VN\\n\"),\n",

Department of Telecommunications (DoT), through its letter dated 07.12.2021 had requested TRAI to provide recommendations under Section 11(1)(a) of TRAI Act, 1997 (as amended) on allowing sharing of core network elements also such as MSC, HLR, IN etc., among telecom operators. Subsequently, the DoT through its letter dated 10.02.2022, mentioning its earlier reference dated 07.12.2021, informed that to promote optimum resource utilization among the licensees, it is proposed to allow sharing of all kinds of telecom infrastructure and network elements among all categories of service providers licensed under the Section 4 of Indian Telegraph, Act, 1885 for provision of authorized telecom services, and requested TRAI to submit its recommendations on the subject. Considering the request of stakeholders to permit inter-band spectrum sharing and leasing of spectrum in the country, the Authority decided to take up the issues related to spectrum sharing and leasing of spectrum along with the issues related to the infrastructure sharing in the stakeholders’ consultation. National Digital Communications Policy (NDCP) 2018 recognizes spectrum as a key natural resource for public benefit to achieve India’s socio-economic goals. NDCP 2018 aims to further liberalize the spectrum sharing, leasing, and trading regime in the country. The newly enacted Telecommunications Act, 2023 provides that the Central Government may permit the sharing, trading, leasing and surrender of assigned spectrum, subject to the terms and conditions, including applicable fees or charges, as may be prescribed. On 13.01.2023, TRAI issued a Consultation Paper on Telecommunication Infrastructure Sharing, Spectrum Sharing, and Spectrum Leasing for soliciting comments/counter comments from stakeholders. In response, 21 comments, and five counter comments were received from stakeholders. An open house discussion on the consultation paper was held on 24.05.2023 through virtual mode. Based on the comments/counter comments received from stakeholders, and on its own analysis, TRAI has finalized the Recommendations on ‘Telecommunication Infrastructure Sharing, Spectrum Sharing, and Spectrum Leasing’. The salient features of the recommendations are as follows:\\nThrough these recommendations, the TRAI has also provided the essential terms and conditions for the implementation of the above recommendations. The implementation of the recommendations on telecommunication infrastructure sharing will help telecom service providers in greater cost efficiencies and improved time to market. The recommendations on mandatory sharing of passive infrastructure laid under the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) projects are aimed at extending the benefits of telecommunication coverage in underserved areas to more than one telecom service providers through effective utilization of Government funded infrastructure. Further, the recommendations on mandatory roaming on the mobile network infrastructure built with Government funding in remote and far-flung areas are aimed at reducing the hardship being faced by the subscribers due to connectivity issues of the home network provider. At present only spectrum trading and intra-band spectrum sharing are permitted in the country. For a more efficient utilization of the scarce spectrum, the TRAI has recommended that spectrum leasing and inter-band spectrum sharing should also be permitted. Implementation of these recommendations will enable telecom service providers to provide better quality of service and wider coverage of telecommunication services. Further, the recommendations for exploring the possibility of implementing authorized shared access (ASA) technique-based spectrum sharing are aimed at further strengthening the efficient and effective utilization of the scarce resource. The Recommendations have been placed on TRAI’s website www.trai.gov.in.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'TRAI_releases_recommendations_on_“Encour.txt', 'Ministry': 'Ministry_of_Communications', 'Month': 'April24html'}, page_content='TRAI releases recommendations on “Encouraging Innovative Technologies, Services, Use Cases and Business Models through Regulatory Sandbox in Digital Communication Sector”\\n\\n\\nTelecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) today released its recommendations on “Encouraging Innovative Technologies, Services, Use Cases, and Business Models through Regulatory Sandbox in Digital Communication Sector”. In view of new technological developments in 5G/6G, Machine to Machine Communications, Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things, Virtual Reality, and others, there is a need to provide an environment in which new technologies, services, use cases and business models can be tested in live networks, or existing functions or processes can be refined. To address this pressing need, the Department of Telecommunications wrote to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India on March 10, 2023, requesting, TRAI’s recommendations regarding a regulatory sandbox framework for new services, technologies, and business models in the digital communication industry. In consideration of the DoT reference, the TRAI published a Consultation Paper (CP) on June 19, 2023, inviting feedback from stakeholders. Regulatory Sandbox (RS) makes real-time but regulated access to telecom network and customer resources, something that is not possible in conventional methods of lab testing or pilots. Specific and generic exemptions in regulations, valid only for RS testing, are granted for testing of new ideas. Regulatory bodies in many countries have established such sandbox frameworks. Providing such a framework for live testing in India will encourage more entrepreneurs to develop solutions for the digital communication industry of the country as well as the world. Subsequently, the Central Government inter-alia made following provisions in the Telecommunication Act’ 2023 notified on December 24, 2023:\\n“The Central Government may, for the purposes of encouraging and facilitating innovation and technological development in telecommunication, create one or more regulatory sandboxes, in such manner, and for such duration, as may be prescribed. Explanation. — For the purposes of this section, the expression “regulatory sandbox” refers to a live testing environment where new products, services, processes, and business models which may be deployed, on a limited set of users, for a specified period of time, with certain relaxations from the provisions of this Act.”\\nThe DoT has also issued guidelines on 11.03.2024 to establish and operate ‘Spectrum Regulatory Sandbox’ (SRS) or ‘WiTe Zones (Wireless Test Zones)’ to promote R&D activities, outdoor testing/experimentation in the field of emerging new radio communications technologies. However, these guidelines do not provide for any connectivity with PSTN/Public commercial network/satellite, for the purpose of testing/Research & Development (R&D) i.e., testing in WiTe Zones does not allow exposure of products to live network environments. Beyond offline/laboratory/WiTe Zone testing, there will be a requirement for testing the products in actual live network environments. Also, apart from exemptions that are related to spectrum, some products may require other types of regulatory relaxations for testing in live network requirements. Based on the reference received from DoT, stakeholder feedback, and in line with the definition of Regulatory Sandbox as provided in the Telecommunication Act’ 2023, which emphasize on testing of new products, services, processes, and business models in live testing environment on a limited set of users for a specified period of time after obtaining certain regulatory relaxations, the Authority has finalized its recommendations. The recommendations outline all the relevant components in detail and offer a comprehensive framework for conducting Sandbox testing for the Digital Communication sector. As part of the recommendations, the Authority has outlined the objective and boundaries of the RS framework. The recommended RS framework for Digital Communication sector details the qualification to take part in the RS testing, essential requirements that participants must meet, supporting paperwork needed to demonstrate eligibility, the application, evaluation & approval procedure, the authority to waive or amend rules, validity period, procedures for authorization revocation, and the reporting requirements. Indian companies or partnership firms, limited liability partnerships or a research institute who have done limited prior testing of their products/services/applications and meet all conditions mentioned in the framework can apply for regulatory sandbox testing. As the RS testing will be carried out in live networks on certain set of users, the framework has kept the security of networks and protection of customers in mind. Accordingly, it has been provided in the RS framework that the applicants will have to, inter-alia, provide details of regulatory exemptions sought, risk mitigation safeguards proposed, consumer protection mechanism suggested, and a well-defined exit strategy as part of their application. To ensure accountability on part of Government agencies involved, strict timelines have been provided for completing the application evaluation process. The regulatory framework includes clear documentation requirements and application, evaluation & approval procedures to ensure transparency throughout the RS process. Additionally, a detailed reporting mechanism has been defined to monitor the progress and outcomes of regulatory sandbox testing effectively. The framework provides that permission granted under the RS will have a validity period of up to 12 months for testing its product. However, provisions have been incorporated for extending the validity period or to early close/terminate the testing, if so required. An overseeing body has been proposed to monitor and evaluate regulatory sandbox testing so as to keep it on track and take necessary corrective measures, if required. The Telecommunication Act’ 2023 has already extended the scope of Digital Bharat Nidhi to facilitate innovation and experimentation in the telecom sector by extending suitable financial support. As part of the regulatory sandbox framework, the authority has recognized that some of the innovations can have potential to bridge the digital divide and bring socio-economic advancement to under privileged sections of the society, if deployed on wider scale. However, despite being very promising, such innovation may lack adequate funding support and, therefore, the authority has recommended that such deserving innovations may be considered to get funding support for testing under RS Framework under Clause 25 (b), (c) and (d) of the Telecommunication Act’ 2023. The recommended Regulatory Sandbox framework is expected to give the Digital Communication industry’s startup ecosystem access to real network environments and other data of telecom network to help test the reliability of new applications before bringing them to market. The framework provides for using cross-sector cooperation in carrying out RS testing with the help of other ministries and agencies. By providing a RS framework that enable various digital communication sector entities to work together in a structured manner, these recommendations are expected to synergize the efforts of innovators, startups, telecommunications companies, government agencies, and regulators to boost innovation and start-up eco system.

Onion export prohibition has been imposed to ensure adequate domestic availability against the backdrop of estimated lower Kharif and Rabi crops in 2023-24 as compared to previous year and increase demand in international market. The National Cooperative Exports Limited (NCEL), the agency for export of onion to these countries, sourced the domestic onions to be exported through e-platform at L1 prices and supplied to the agency or agencies nominated by the government of the destination country at the negotiated rate on 100% advance payment basis. The offer rate of NCEL to the buyers takes into account the prevailing prices in the destination market and also international and domestic markets. The quota allocated for export to the six countries are being supplied as per requisition made by the destination country. As the largest producer of onion in the country, Maharashtra is the major supplier of onions sourced by NCEL for export. The Government had also allowed export of 2000 MT of white onion cultivated specially for export markets in Middle-East and some European countries. Being purely export oriented, production cost of the white onion is higher than other onions due to higher seed cost, adoption of good agricultural practice (GAP) and compliance to strict maximum residue limits (MRL) requirements. The procurement target for onion buffer out of Rabi-2024 under the Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF) of Department of Consumer Affairs has been fixed at 5 Lakh tons this year. The Central Agencies, viz., NCCF and NAFED are tying up local agencies such as FPOs/FPCs/PACs to support the procurement, storage and farmers registration to begin the procurement of any store-worthy onion. A high level team of DoCA, NCCF and NAFED had visited Nashik and Ahmednagar Districts of Maharashtra during 11-13 April, 2024 to create awareness among the farmers, FPOs/FPCs and PACs about the procurement of 5 LMT of onion for PSF buffer. In order to reduce the storage loss of onions, the Department of Consumer Affairs decided to enhance the quantum of stocks to be irradiated and cold stored from 1200 MT last year to over 5000 MT this year, with technical support from BARC, Mumbai. The pilot of onion irradiation and cold storage taken up last year has been found to have resulted in the reduction of storage loss to less than 10 percent. ***\\nAD/NS\\n'),\n",

The operation involved the airlifting of Indian Army soldiers by the IAF and dropping them on the glacial peaks. Although the operation began in 1984, IAF helicopters were already operating in the Siachen Glacier since 1978, flying the Chetak helicopters which was the first IAF helicopter to land in the Glacier in\\xa0 October 1978. By 1984, Pakistan's cartographic aggression in the uncharted territory of Ladakh, allowing foreign mountaineering expeditions in Siachen, was becoming a cause of concern. Having received intelligence inputs about an impending Pakistani military action in the area, India decided to thwart Pakistan's efforts to legitimize its claim on Siachen. The Indian Army launched Operation Meghdoot, to secure strategic heights on Siachen with the deployment of troops. Playing an irreplaceable role in this effort, IAF's tactical and strategic airlifters, An-12s, An-32s and IL-76s transported stores and troops and air-dropped supplies to high altitude airfields, from where Mi-17, Mi-8, Chetak and Cheetah helicopters ferried men and material to dizzying heights on the glacier, far above the limits set by the helicopter manufacturers. Soon, about 300-odd troops were positioned on the strategically important peaks and passes of the glacier. By the time the Pakistan army reacted by advancing its own troops, the Indian Army was occupying strategically crucial mountain peaks and passes, thereby gaining a tactical advantage. In extending valuable support to the Army's fight for maintaining military dominance on this desolate glacier since April 1984, the IAF's incredible performance at the extremes of temperature and altitude remains a continuing saga of fortitude and skill. While the initial operations involved only the use of transport and helicopter aircraft transporting men and material, the IAF gradually expanded its role and presence in the region with the deployment of fighter aircraft as well. The IAF's Hunter aircraft kick-started fighter operations from the high altitude airfield at Leh, when a detachment of Hunters from No 27 Squadron commenced operations in September 1984. In the next couple of years, the Hunters flew an impressive total of more than 700 sorties from Leh. As an increasingly large number of fighter sweeps and simulated strikes began to be carried out over the glacier itself, it served as the ultimate morale booster for Indian troops deployed on the glacier, and sent a stern message to the adversary to avoid any misadventures in the area. Later, live armament sorties were carried out at the high altitude firing range at Kar Tso, south of Leh. With the ground infrastructure becoming more conducive for fighter flying, MiG-23s and MiG-29s also started operating from Leh and Thoise. The IAF also inducted the Cheetal helicopters for operating in the glacier in 2009. The Cheetal is a Cheetah helicopter which is re-engineered with a TM 333 2M2 engine having better reliability and load carrying capability at high altitude. More recently, on 20 August 2013, in a significant show of capability, the IAF landed one of its latest acquisitions, the Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules four-engine transport aircraft at Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO), the world's highest airstrip, near the line of actual control in Ladakh. Today, nearly all the aircraft of the IAF including Rafale, Su-30MKI, Chinook, Apache, Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk III & Mk IV, Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) Prachand, MiG-29, Mirage-2000, C-17 , C-130 J, IL-76 and An-32 operate in support of Op Meghdoot. In the highest battlefield in the world, known for its extreme climatic conditions, IAF helicopters form the lifeline and the sole link of Indian troops with the outside world, playing a critical role in continuing the four decade old military operation; responding to emergencies, supplying essential logistics and evacuating the sick and wounded from the 78 km long glacier. Flying in such ruthless terrain, records of human endurance, flying and technical proficiency are being set by the IAF nearly every day. ***\\nABB/AM/SM\\n\"),\n",

In light of global warming, the Arctic has witnessed a significant loss of sea ice in the past decade, while the Antarctic experienced a moderate increase until 2015 followed by a sudden decrease since 2016. Notably, the Antarctic saw extremely low sea ice conditions during each summer from 2016 to 2023, with unprecedented slow ice expansion or retreat in 2023. The slow ice expansion in Antarctic occurred ahead of the annual maximum on 7 September 2023 with an ice extent of 16.98 million km2, which was 1.46 million km2 below the long-term average. The underlying cause of the observed sea ice changes remained a crucial question both for the scientific community and policymakers. The findings suggest the excessive upper-ocean heat contributed for reducing the ice expansion in 2023, but the atmospheric circulation changes were considerable and played an important role. The change in wind pattern such as the extremely deep Amundsen Sea Low and its eastward shift resulted in strong northerly flow across the Weddell Sea. The northerly wind gave record atmospheric warming and forced the ice-edge to remain southward from its usual position. It is important to mention that the Amundsen Sea Low, being a low-pressure system, is known to exert considerable influence on the climate fluctuations of West Antarctica and the surrounding oceanic conditions. In the Ross Sea, rapid changes in ice extent occurred mainly due to the record strengthening of an atmospheric block that gave strong northerly winds off the Ross Ice Shelf. In summary, an impact of exceptional ocean-atmospheric warming and changes in winds, combined with heat fluxes, extreme winds and high ocean waves associated with polar cyclones (storms), contributed to the record low ice conditions in Antarctic. In particular, cyclones caused episodes of exceptional slow ice expansion or even retreat. For instance, the ice-edge in the Weddell Sea was moved southwards quickly in a few days (up to 256 km southward) with an ice area loss of ~2.3 × 105 km2, equivalent to the size of United Kingdom. The low ice conditions is likely to have a significant impact on the amplification of global warming (through ice-albedo feedback process), life in the Southern Ocean, the regional ecosystem, ocean circulation, ice shelf stability, and sea level rise. Considering the relatively short records of satellite observations (~45 years), it is difficult to assess whether the decrease in ice extent observed during the past seven years and current reduction in ice growth is part of a long-term decline as projected by climate models. While natural climate variability plays a significant role in the recent decrease in ice extent, the effect of anthropogenic factors is also important in triggering such an anomalous event.'),\n",

He told media that the expected La Nina, positive IOD and below normal snow cover over northern hemisphere would be favourable for rainfall during southwest monsoon season 2024. Giving a detailed presentation DG, IMD, Dr Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said that currently, moderate El Niño conditions are prevailing over the equatorial Pacific region and the Climate model forecasts indicate neutral condition by the beginning of monsoon season and La Niña conditions during second half of monsoon season. Dr. M. Mohapatra, DG, Indian Meteorological Department\\nHe also informed the media that at present neutral Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) conditions are prevailing and Climate model forecast indicate positive IOD conditions likely to develop during the monsoon season. He added that since Sea Surface temperature conditions over the pacific and the Indian Ocean are known to have a strong influence on the Indian Monsoon, IMD is carefully monitoring the evolution of sea surface conditions over these ocean basins. Dr Mohapatra further said that Northern hemisphere snow cover extent during the last three months (January to March 2024) was below normal which indicates above rainfall this monsoon season. Winter and spring snow cover extent over Northern Hemisphere as well as Eurasia has a generally inverse relationship with the subsequent monsoon season rainfall.

In such cases, the Department has alerted the taxpayers to enable them to take corrective action. However, some posts on social media, as well as articles in the media, have highlighted enquiries initiated by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) in cases where employees have made incorrect claims of HRA and rent paid. At the outset, it is stated that any apprehensions about retrospective taxation on these matters and re-opening of cases on issues pertaining to HRA claims is completely baseless. Data analysis was carried out in some high-value cases of mismatch between the rent paid by the employee and receipt of rent by the recipient for the FY 2020-21.

During FY 2023-24 CBDT also signed the maximum number of BAPAs in any financial year till date. The BAPAs were signed as a consequence of entering into Mutual Agreements with India’s treaty partners namely Australia, Canada, Denmark, Japan, Singapore, the UK and the US. The APA Scheme endeavours to provide certainty to taxpayers in the domain of transfer pricing by specifying the methods of pricing and determining the arm’s length price of international transactions in advance for a maximum of five future years. Further, the taxpayer has the option to rollback the APA for four preceding years, as a result of which, tax certainty is provided for nine years. The signing of bilateral APAs additionally provides the taxpayers with protection from any anticipated or actual double taxation.

Future Directions:\\nExpansion and Enhancement: ABHA is expected to evolve and expand over time, incorporating new features and functionalities to meet the evolving needs of the healthcare sector. Integration with other Schemes: There is potential to integrate ABHA with other healthcare schemes and initiatives to create a unified and comprehensive healthcare ecosystem. Research and Innovation: Continued research and innovation in healthcare financing and delivery models can further strengthen the effectiveness and impact of ABHA. MYTH VERSUS REALITY:\\nReality: No, ABHA is just an unique number used to link all the health records of a person. Reality: Ayushman Bharat Health Account does not mean the eligibility of a person for the particular scheme including AB-PMJAY. Ayushman Bharat Health Account is not a replacement of current CGHS services or a replacement of current CGHS HMIS. Rather it is an addition/add-on to the current services offered by CGHS. Myth 3: I am afraid that by linking all my health records to my ABHA other doctors may be in a position to see all my medical History which I don’t want to show. How can this be prevented? Reality: The consent provided digitally need not be for all the health records linked to ABHA at a time. It can be provided for sharing only selected health records as per the choice of the patient. Therefore, by linking all your health records to your ABHA you will not end up sharing all your health records when providing consent. The consent is granular “which can be provided separately for each of the health records as per the wish of the patient”. However, it is recommended that you provide consent to share all health records with your doctor so that he can make correct clinical decisions. Myth 4: Is it possible for the government or any other entity to do surveillance of the health status of an individual through ABDM? Reality: No. The health records are created and stored at the place of their creation by respective healthcare providers (which is the case even now). ABDM is creating interoperable platforms for linking these data repositories/fiduciaries. This is known as federated architecture. This means that the health records will continue to be processed and stored at the same place where they are created, which has been happening prior to ABDM as well. The government will not have access to such data. No additional means of accessing such data is being created or envisaged in the current ecosystem. Myth 5 : Will my Digital health Records be shared with other doctors or health facility without my permission? Reality: No. Only you can share your own records with other doctors/hospitals using different digital health systems after giving your consent. Myth 6: How will my data be used by the government? Reality: Protocols for anonymization and aggregation of data and use of such data will be defined after extensive stakeholder consultations. After that, anonymous records can be used by the government to make policies and other relevant interventions in the interests of the public. Till this is done, health records will not be used by the government. Reality: ABDM does not store any medical records. These are always created and stored by healthcare providers as per their retention policies and this will continue. ABDM only facilitates secure data exchange between the intended stakeholders on ABDM network after the patient’s consent. Hence, through ABDM compliant applications, patients will also be able to choose which health records they want to link with their Health IDs, securely store their digital health records on their devices, securely access their records online, and securely share their health records with healthcare providers after the patient’s consent. Only the data collected for registries such as Health ID registry, Healthcare Professional Registry and Healthcare Facility Registry is stored centrally. It is necessary for these datasets to be stored centrally because they are essential to provide interoperability, trust, and identification and single source of truth across different digital health systems. This data is stored and processed in secure and safe manner. Reality: Yes, ABHA can be used outside the government hospital/ program. However, it is up to the private players to decide whether they want to use it or not. For example, a private hospital may decide to use ABHA for creation and linking of health record. *****\\nMV\\nHFW/ABHA Explainer/4thApril2024/1\\n'),\n",

Kicking off from the popular Khan Market and INA Market of Delhi on 8th April, 2024, the awareness campaign will focus particularly on the detection and mitigation of pesticide residue and contaminants in food products. Market associations and traders were actively engaged and educated on the harmful effects of pesticide residue, mainly in fruits and vegetables and the importance of their testing. Additionally, attendees were introduced to FSSAI\\'s pioneering initiative, the \"Food Safety on Wheel\" mobile lab, equipped with various rapid testing kits capable of detecting approximately 50 pesticide residues across various food matrices, namely, fruits and vegetables, milk and cereals. Results from these tests are available within a few hours, facilitating swift action to ensure food safety. Traders were encouraged to capitalize on this resource for expedited testing and to ensure the safety and quality of products sold in the market. Furthermore, they were also sensitized about a wide array of topics concerning food safety like the necessity of obtaining FSSAI licenses or registration and strict adherence to food safety standards. Traders were encouraged to source raw materials exclusively from FSSAI licensed/registered vendors to ensure traceability and compliance. Further, the significance of raw material testing to guarantee the safety and quality of food products was emphasized during the programme. Awareness regarding artificial ripening and wax coating of fruits and vegetables using unapproved chemicals and role of organic farming was created among the attendees. Attendees were informed about the availability of testing laboratories for food products in Delhi and nearby areas. The event emphasized the collective responsibility in ensuring food safety, with the mantra, \"Food Safety is Everyone\\'s Responsibility\" and also the importance of vital role of every stakeholder across the food supply chain in fostering a healthier India.

These reports further claim that more than 500 medicines will be affected by this increase in price. Such reports are false, misleading and malicious. As per the provisions of Drug Price Control Orders (DPCO) 2013, drugs are categorized as scheduled and non-scheduled formulations. The formulations which are listed in Schedule-I of DPCO 2013 are scheduled formulations and the formulations that are not specified in Schedule-I of DPCO 2013 are non-schedule formulations. National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) under the Department of Pharmaceuticals annually revises the ceiling prices of scheduled medicines on the basis of Wholesale Price Index (WPI). The scheduled medicines included in the Schedule-I of the DPCO, 2013 are essential medicines. During the calendar year 2023 over the corresponding period in 2022, the annual change in WPI with base year 2011-12 was (+) 0.00551% as per data published by Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT). Accordingly, the Authority in its meeting held on 20.03.2024 has approved the WPI increase @ (+) 0.00551% for the scheduled medicines. The ceiling prices on 923 medicines are effective as on date. Based on the above mentioned WPI factor of (+) 0.00551%, there will be no change in the prevailing ceiling prices for 782 medicines and the existing ceiling prices will continue to prevail up to 31.03.2025. Fifty-Four (54) medicines with ceiling price ranging from Rs. 90 to Rs. 261 will have miniscule increase of Rs. 0.01(one paisa). As the permissible price increase is miniscule, the companies may or may not avail this increase. Thus, in the year FY 2024-25, there will be almost no change in the ceiling price of medicines based on WPI. The WPI increase is the maximum increase permissible as per the DPCO, 2013 and the manufacturers may or may not avail this increase, keeping in view the market dynamics. The companies adjust their Maximum Retail Price (MRP) depending upon the ceiling price of their medicines, as MRP (excluding GST) can be any price which is less than the ceiling price. The revised prices will be applicable from 1st April 2024 and the detail of revised prices is available on NPPA’s website www.nppaindia.nic.in. In case of non-scheduled formulation, a manufacturer is at liberty to fix the price. However, no manufacturer of non-scheduled formulation can increase the MRP by more than 10% during preceding 12 months under Para 20 of DPCO, 2013. ****\\nMV\\nHFW/MythsVsFacts – WPI Revision/03rd April/2024/1\\n'),\n",

He had an engaging meeting with CEO Mr. Juergen Kwik & CEO of Poonawalla Science Park (PSP) at Bilthoven Mr. Jef De Clercq on EU pandemic preparedness partnership and collaboration on production of vaccines. He met the senior management and was briefed on the various manufacturing units of the facility. A detailed presentation was made on their future manufacturing plans. Bilthoven Biologicals B.V. Co., manufactures pharmaceutical products such as vaccines for polio, diphtheria-tetanus-polio, and tetanus along with bacillus calmette-guerin (BCG). The bioengineering and vaccine production firm Bilthoven Biologicals was purchased by Serum India Ltd., in 2012. This has strengthened its capacity of producing vaccines and also provided it with a valuable manufacturing base in Europe. Recently Serum and Bharat Biotech have announced collaboration for enhanced production of OPV. Bharat Biotech will collaborate with Netherlands-based Bilthoven Biologicals B.V, a wholly-owned arm of Serum Institute of India. An agreement has been signed under which Bharat Biotech will procure drug substances for manufacturing oral polio vaccines to be supplied within India and globally. This will contribute to supply security of oral polio vaccines. With this partnership, the capacity of BBIL to manufacture Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) has increased to 500 million doses every year. Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP) of the Union Health Ministry is one of the key interventions for protection of children from life threatening conditions by providing vaccination, including vaccine against polio. India has been certified free of Polio in March 2014. However, to maintain the polio-free status, polio vaccine is given to children as part of the high quality national and sub-national polio rounds across the country. A sustained supply of OPV is essential for keeping India polio free.

The deadline, which was earlier March 31, 2024, has been extended to April 10, 2024 for the ease of submission of projects by filmmakers working in geographically remote areas of the country. The Bazaar will be held from 16th to 18th June 2024, in Mumbai. The Doc Film Bazaar aims to be a first-of-its-kind comprehensive platform designed to promote and support documentary, short films and animation content showcasing talent in filmmaking, production and distribution. The key segments of the Doc Film Bazaar consist of Doc Co-Production Market (Doc CPM), Doc Viewing Room (Doc VR) and Doc Work-In-Progress Lab (Doc WIP) for which the filmmakers are invited to submit their films. Doc Co-Production Market (CPM) is a platform exclusively designed to find artistic and financial support from the global film fraternity. It is a segment to facilitate partnerships between filmmakers and potential producers or co-producers globally. It provides a platform for collaboration, co-productions and funding opportunities for documentary and animation film projects. Filmmakers can pitch their projects and explore avenues for financial support and collaboration from both domestic and international level. The selected projects from the Doc Co-Production Market will get an opportunity to pitch their project in an Open Pitch session as well as a dedicated space to have One-to-One meetings with the producers, distributors and financiers. The Viewing Room (VR) is a platform for filmmakers to showcase their documentary, shorts and animation film. It is a restricted space where registered delegates are granted access to view a curated selection of the films and this platform is ideal for films seeking world sales, distribution partners, co-producers, finishing funds and screenings at film festivals.

The data indicates that around 7.78 lakh new members have been enrolled during February, 2024. A noticeable aspect of the data is the dominance of the 18-25 age group, constituting a significant 56.36% of the total new members added in February 2024 indicating the majority of individuals joining the organized workforce are youth, primarily first-time job seekers. The payroll data highlights that approximately 11.78 lakh members exited and subsequently rejoined EPFO. These members switched their jobs and re-joined the establishments covered under the ambit of EPFO and opted to transfer their accumulations instead of applying for final settlement thus, safeguarding long-term financial well-being and extending their social security protection. Gender-wise analysis of payroll data unveils that out of 7.78 lakh new members, around 2.05 lakh are new female members. Also, the net female member addition during the month stood at around 3.08 lakh. The female member addition is indicative of a broader shift towards a more inclusive and diverse workforce. Month-on-month comparison of industry-wise data displays growth in the members working in establishments engaged in the industries viz. establishments engaged in manufacture, marketing servicing & usage of computers, companies/societies/assc/clubs/troupes for performances, road motor transport, automobile servicing, Textiles etc. Of the total net membership, around 41.53% addition is from expert services (consisting of manpower suppliers, normal contractors, security services, miscellaneous activities etc.). The above payroll data is provisional since the data generation is a continuous exercise, as updating employee record is a continuous process. The previous data hence gets updated every month. From the month of April-2018, EPFO has been releasing payroll data covering the period September, 2017 onwards. In monthly payroll data, the count of members joining EPFO for the first time through Aadhaar validated Universal Account Number (UAN), existing members exiting from coverage of EPFO and those who exited but re-joining as members, is taken to arrive at net monthly payroll. *****\\nMJPS\\n'),\n",

The Conference was attended by a large audience and eminent guests comprising of judges of various High Courts, President and Vice President and Members of ITAT, advocates, academicians, representatives of law enforcement agencies, police officials, public prosecutors, District Judges and other officials and law students. The Conference was set on the backdrop of the\\xa0 enactment of three\\xa0 Criminal Laws, namely Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita 2023, Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita 2023 and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam 2023 given their being brought into effect from 1st July , 2024. The Chief Justice of India, Dr. Justice D.Y. Chandrachud graced the occasion as the Chief Guest.

Attorney General for India, Shri Tushar Mehta, Ld. Solicitor General of India and Shri S. K. G. Rahate Secretary, Department of Justice in the Ministry of Law & Justice. At the outset, Dr. Anju Rathi Rana, Additional Secretary, Department of Legal Affairs, outlined the objectives of the Conference and briefly highlighted the importance of the three Laws, which symbolise a break from the shackles of colonial legal legacy. In his welcome address, Dr. Rajiv Mani, Secretary, Department of Legal Affairs, Ministry of Law and Justice, highlighted the background of the enactment of the\\xa0 three criminal laws and how it unshackles the legal structure and framework created by the Britishers and meant to perpetuate the British rule in India on the ostentatious ground of establishing Rule of Law. The existing criminal laws which trace their origin to the colonial era need to come out and define the State- Citizen relationship not based on colonial prejudices and practices but on the principles of access of justice to all . The three laws have hence been enacted to overhaul the criminal justice system in the country to make it citizen-centric . Delivering his keynote address, the Chief Justice of India, Dr. Justice D.Y. Chandrachud said that\\xa0 the new Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita(BNSS) provides a holistic approach to deal with crimes in the digital age. The BNSS also stipulates that criminal trials must be completed in three years, and judgments must be pronounced within 45 days of being reserved. This would help in clearing the vast backlogs and faster delivery of justice. The Hon'ble CJI particularly mentioned that it is very heartening to notice that Section 530 of the BNSS allows all trials, inquiries, and proceedings may be conducted in electronical mode, which is in keeping with the need of the present time. He also invited attention to the importance of protecting privacy in the digital age, especially when dealing with the digitisation of proceedings and of matters pertaining to digital evidence. The Chief Justice of India further highlighted that while the three criminal laws create provisions which are synchronised to our times, there is a need for creation of adequate infrastructure for all stakeholders to derive benefit from these laws fully. He highlighted the creation of digital court infrastructure to create technologically equipped court systems for efficient case management for all. The CJI concluded by stating that laws and their implementation are an ever-evolving area. There is no finality to any law or the manner of its implementation. However, one must be willing to embrace positive changes to meet the needs of the times. Speaking on the occasion, Shri Arjun Ram Meghwal, Minister of State (Independent Charge), Ministry of Law and Justice pointed out the need for changes in the Criminal Justice system, which was initially brought into effect from the perspective of colonial rulers and lacked Indian spirit and ethos.

Some of the non-fuel minerals showing positive growth during the month of Feb 2024 as compared to the corresponding month of the previous year are Bauxite, Chromite, Copper Concentrate, Gold, Zinc Concentrate, Manganese Ore, Phosphorite, Diamond, Graphite (R.O.M.), Limestone, Magnesite, etc. Iron ore and Limestone together account for about 80% of the total MCDR mineral production by value. Production of these key minerals in the country has exhibited high growth in FY24 as per provisional figures. Iron ore production has increased from 230 million metric ton (MMT) during the 11-month period April-Feb of FY23 to 252 MMT during the corresponding period of FY24, at 9.6% growth. The full year production of iron ore in FY24 is likely to break the production record of 258 MMT achieved in FY23. Showing a similar trend, limestone production has increased from 366 MMT during the 11-month period April-Feb of FY23 to 407 MMT during the corresponding period of FY24, at 11.2% growth, and has already surpassed the full year production record of 406.5 MMT achieved in FY23. In the non-ferrous metal sector, production of primary Aluminium metal has increased from 37.11 lakh ton (LT) during the 11-month period April-Feb of FY23 to 38.02 LT during the corresponding period of FY24, at 2.5% growth. The full year production of primary Aluminium in FY24 is likely to break the production record of 40.73 LT achieved in FY23. India is the 2nd largest Aluminium producer, 3rd largest lime producer and 4th largest iron ore producer in the world. Healthy growth in production of iron ore and limestone reflect the robust demand conditions in the user industries viz. steel and cement. Coupled with the high growth in Aluminium, these growth trends point towards strong economic activity in user sectors such as energy, infrastructure, construction, automotive and machinery. ****\\nST\\n'),\n",

Shri R Lakshmanan, Joint Secretary, MoPSW said “The two-day conference at Kochi successfully facilitated enriching discussions encompassing India’s key priorities including Green Transition of Inland Waterways, establishment of a dedicated Sectoral Maritime Development Fund, promoting domestic shipbuilding, etc. This is one among many such meetings being conducted by the ministry to identify and address the key challenges faced by the maritime stakeholders in achieving the targets set forth in Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047.”\\nThe inaugural session brought to the fore MoPSW’s decarbonization efforts in the Inland Waterways sector being spearheaded by IWAI and CSL by deployment of Green Hydrogen Fuel Cell Inland Vessels, aligning with MoPSW's Harit Nauka Guidelines. Varanasi has been selected as the pilot location for immediate deployment on NW-1, with expansion plans informed by pilot learnings. It was discussed that discussions are ongoing with potential players for facilities such as bunkering, etc. Furthemore, it was informed that due to its low emission qualities, Methanol is also actively considered as one of the key green fuels for EXIM Vessels globally as seen in the recent case of Maersk’s deployment of Methanol Powered Ships. Going forward, it was suggested to explore mechanisms of developing indigenous development of Methanol marine engines in the country as a progressive step towards Green Transition of Inland Vessels. Ongoing roundtable discussion at the conference in Kochi\\nThe afternoon session delved into the pressing financing needs of India's shipping sector, underscoring the mammoth investment requirement of approximately Rs 70-75 Lakh Crore as outlined in the Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047. Despite this substantial need to support the country's projected trade and economic expansion, there's a notable absence of forthcoming finance sources, including bank credit and foreign investment. The discussion illuminated various financing challenges encountered by Indian maritime stakeholders, particularly in the shipping sector. These challenges include the non-availability of long-term funding, which is crucial for sustainable growth, along with lower interest rates. Additionally, the presence of fixed sectoral lending limits as per RBI credit concentration norms poses a significant hurdle, restricting the availability of credit by capping each bank's exposure to individual companies or networks of companies. Moreover, the lack of asset-based financing by Banks/Financial Institutions (FIs) acts as a deterrent for shipping sector borrowers. In response to these challenges Shri R Lakshmanan, Joint Secretary, MoPSW, shared insights into the ministry's proactive efforts. The ministry is actively working on establishing a dedicated Maritime Development Fund, akin to established sectoral Financial Institutions such as Power Finance Corp. Ltd, REC, IRFC, etc. This fund aims to cater to the unique and substantial funding requirements of the maritime sector, enabling the implementation of specific initiatives such as shipbuilding, decarbonization, green energy adoption, technology innovation, and manpower training and development. Industry stakeholders warmly welcomed this initiative and provided valuable feedback, recognizing its potential to address the pressing financing needs and propel the holistic development of the maritime sector as envisioned in Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047. Water Metro operating in Kochi\\n\\nThe programme’s evening agenda included a tour of the Kochi Water Metro and projects under the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI), highlighting the strategic focus on bolstering river cruise tourism, advancing urban water transport networks along inland waterways, and fostering the growth of coastal shipping. The government recognizes IWT as a more economical and environmentally friendly mode of transportation. In Day 2 of the conference, for the first session, stakeholders from various sectors including inland vessel operators, cruise operators, vessel builders, ship management companies, cargo owners, state water transport departments, and Kochi water metro convened to address challenges and explore possible interventions. Discussions centered on traffic patterns along NW-3, NW-8, and NW-9, alongside initiatives aimed at optimizing cargo movement. These efforts align with the goal of boosting the modal share of Inland Water Transport (IWT) to 5% by 2030 and 7% by 2047, as outlined in Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047. Stakeholders strategize ways to enhance inland water transport modal share during a dynamic conference session\\nThe final session of the two-day conference centered on India's shipbuilding capacity, highlighting its current global ranking at 22nd with less than 1% of global share. Discussions underscored the nation's heavy reliance on foreign fleets for cargo movement, resulting in significant foreign exchange expenditure. Stakeholders engaged in dialogues to understand and highlight financing and operational challenges faced by shipbuilders and owners, emphasizing the role of interventions in existing policies and necessary reforms to boost the Indian fleet size and ownership. Key topics included enhancing frameworks, increasing research and development efforts, and advocating for global promotion of MAKV 2047 to attract international investment in Indian shipbuilding. Participants were encouraged to submit their challenges, interventions, and policy suggestions post-conference for further consideration. With aspirations to become one of the top 5 shipbuilding nations by 2047, India is strategically focusing on expanding ship ownership and tonnage responsibly, thereby unlocking significant commercial opportunities within the shipbuilding sector. ****\\nMJPS\\n\"),\n",

To ensure maximum power generation from Gas-Based Generating Stations, the Government has issued directions to all Gas-Based Generating Stations under Section 11 of the Electricity Act, 2003 (under which the appropriate government may specify that a generating company shall, in extraordinary circumstances operate and maintain any generating station in accordance with the directions of that Government). A significant portion of the Gas-Based Generating Stations (GBSs) is currently unutilized, primarily due to commercial considerations. The order under Section 11, which is on similar lines as done for imported-coal-based power plants, aims to optimise the availability of power from Gas-Based Generating Stations during the ensuing high demand period. The order shall remain valid for generation and supply of power from May 1, 2024 to June 30, 2024. The order can be accessed here. GRID-INDIA to inform Gas-based Generating Stations of Power Requirement\\nAs per the arrangement, GRID-INDIA will inform the Gas-based Generating Stations in advance, of the number of days for which Gas-based power is required. Gas-Based Generating Stations holding Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with Distribution Licensees shall first offer their power to PPA holders. If the power offered is not utilised by any PPA holder, then it shall be offered in the power market. Gas-Based Generating Stations not tied to PPAs must offer their generation in the power market. A high-level committee headed by Chairperson, Central Electricity Authority has been constituted to facilitate the implementation of this direction. The decision to operationalize gas-based generating stations is part of a series of measures taken by the Government of India, to ensure that the electricity demand in the summer season is met. The Union Minister for Power and New & Renewable Energy Shri R. K. Singh held a series of meetings on this, emphasizing the need for ensuring adequate availability of power to meet the load during the hot-weather season. Other Measures to Meet Summer Electricity Demand\\nThe government has taken the following measures to meet the summer demand, apart from the decision on gas-based generating stations:\\nIndia's electricity demand has been rising rapidly, driven by economic growth, particularly during hot-weather and high-demand periods. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted above-normal maximum temperatures over most parts of the country during the 2024 hot weather season. The above measures are being taken in this context, in anticipation of the high electricity demand during the season.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Hydroelectric_power_projects_with_aggreg.txt', 'Ministry': 'Ministry_of_Power', 'Month': 'April24html'}, page_content='Hydroelectric power projects with aggregate capacity of 15 GW under construction\\n\\nHydro capacity to increase from 42 GW today to 67 GW by 2031-32, marking an increase of more than 50 percentGood monsoon in FY 2024-25 as per IMD prediction to contribute to improvement in water reservoir levels\\nHydroelectric power projects with aggregate capacity of 15 GW are under construction in the country. The hydro capacity is likely to increase from 42 GW to 67 GW by 2031-32, marking an increase of more than half of present capacity. The Indian Meteorological Department has predicted higher rainfall in the current financial year. Further, hydropower projects located in the Himalayan region get base flow from contribution of snowmelt, i.e., from surface runoff produced by melting snow; so, any rise in temperature will increase snowmelt contribution. Moreover, given the ongoing energy transitions in the country, the development of Pumped Storage Projects (PSPs) assumes importance for providing greater inertia and balancing power to the grid. PSPs are also known as ‘the Water Battery’, which is an ideal complement to modern clean energy systems. Currently, PSPs with aggregate capacity of 2.7 GW are under construction in the county and another 50 GW is under various stages of development. It is projected that PSP capacity shall increase from 4.7 GW to around 55 GW by 2031-32. Why the Fall in Hydro Power Generation in 2023-24\\nThe fall in hydro power generation in 2023-24 as compared to 2022-23 cannot be attributed solely to less rainfall. In the southern region, which contributes approximately 22% of the total hydro energy generated, low rainfall has indeed played a role. However, the hydroelectric power projects in Northern and Eastern regions, comprising over 60% of total hydro energy generation, have been severely impacted by natural disasters in 2023-24. In July 2023, Himachal Pradesh experienced flash floods, disrupting the operation of many power stations in the area. Besides, flash floods in the Eastern region in October 2023 have further hindered the operation of several hydro power stations, thus affecting the generation severely. Hydrology of any river basin is variable and follows some period of alternate wet and dry spells. Lower rainfall in the past does not mean that the same type of the rainfall will necessarily occur in the future as well. Potential for Replenishment of Capacity in Water Reservoirs\\nWhile the lightest rainfall since 2018 resulted in reduced water levels in a few reservoirs, the government is reasonably optimistic about the future. The prediction by the IMD of good monsoon in FY 2024-25 suggests a potential reversal of the trend. This anticipated increase in rainfall could contribute to replenishment of reservoir capacities which were lost during the scarce rainfall in the previous year. Further, the current downturn may be temporary rather than indicative of a long-term decline. Contribution of Hydro to Power System\\nIt is important to recognize that the country is in the midst of an energy transition, marked by significant additions of solar and wind power to the current energy mix. Further, power from solar energy is available during the time of the day that does not coincide with the peak power demand. Hydroelectric power has always played a significant role in the energy landscape of the country, providing essential peaking support to the electricity grid, thus enhancing the reliability and resilience of the power system. Share of Hydro in Total Energy Mix and Pace of Addition of Hydro Capacity\\nThe development of hydro power projects has been marred by various issues such as natural calamities, geological surprises and contractual disputes, which have resulted in slower hydro capacity addition in recent years. Nevertheless, aligning with the ambitious targets set forth by India in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) under the COP Paris agreement, which are aimed at reducing emissions intensity of GDP by 45% from 2005 levels by the year 2030 and achieving 50% of installed electric power capacity from non-fossil-fuel sources by the year 2030, the government has adopted a proactive stance towards hydro power development, striving for accelerated progress. Growth in India’s Renewable Energy Capacity\\nIndia’s renewable energy capacity has increased significantly in recent years. As on 30.11.2021, the installed Renewable Energy (RE) capacity of the country stood at 150.54 GW (solar: 48.55 GW, wind: 40.03 GW, Small hydro: 4.83 GW, Bio-power: 10.62 GW, Large Hydro: 46.51 GW) while its nuclear energy based installed capacity stood at 6.78 GW. This brings the total non-fossil-based installed energy capacity to 157.32 GW, which is 40.1% of the total installed electricity capacity of 392.01 GW at the time. Thus, India has overachieved its commitment made at COP 21 Paris Summit by achieving more than 40% of its installed power capacity from non-fossil fuels, almost nine years ahead of its commitment. India is the only G20 country that has fulfilled all commitments it made in Paris on climate change. Subsequent to this, India upgraded its commitments under Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in Glasgow COP26 and in August 2022 communicated its updated NDCs to UNFCCC, which includes:\\nAt the same time, India is targeting to achieve renewable energy capacity more than the committed capacity of 50% from non-fossil sources, by the year 2030. In order to meet 500 GW non-fossil fuel generation capacity, transmission plan has already been prepared and bids for renewable energy capacity have been finalized. All-India Renewable Energy Generation (excluding Large Hydro) has increased steadily from 61.7 billion units in 2014-15 to 225.5 billion units in 2023-24 at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 15.47%. Similarly, the growth in Renewable Energy Installed Capacity (excluding Large Hydro) has increased from 38.96 GW as on 31.03.2015 to 136.57 GW as on 29.02.2024, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 14.94%.

Under the Surya Tilak project, sunlight was brought on the forehead of Sri Ram Lalla at 12 noon on the occasion of Sri Ram Navami in the Chaitra month. IIA team carried out the calculation of the sun position, design and optimisation of the optical system, and performed the integration & alignment at the site. The English calendar date of Sri Ram Navami festival changes every year as it follows Lunar Calendar. Therefore, the position of the sun on the sky changes every year on the day of Sri Ram Navami. Detailed calculations show that the English calendar date of Sri Ram Navami repeats every 19 years. Calculating the position of the sun in the sky on these days requires expertise in astronomy. IIA team led the calculation for identification of the calendar days of \\xa0Sri Ram Navami for one cycle of 19 years followed by its repetition, estimation of the position in the sky on the calendar dates of the Ram Navami. They also led the design of an opto-mechanical system to bring the sunlight from the top of the temple to the forehead of the idol, estimation of the size, shape and location of mirrors and lenses in the system for sufficient light to fall on the idol for about 6 minutes,opto-mechanical design of the lens and mirror holder assembly, and the manual mechanism to shift the position of the first mirror according to the position of the Sun in the sky. Crucial design optimisation as well as simulations were carried out to arrive at various quantities in the opto-mechanical design as well as the functioning of the mechanism. As the temple is not fully complete now, the IIA experts modified the design to suit the existing structure and performed image optimisation. This design, with 4 mirrors and 2 lenses, is executed for the Surya Tilak on 17th April 2024. The IIA technical experts participated in the testing, assembly, integration and validation of the system at cite. The crucial alignment of the mirrors and lenses were performed by the technical experts from IIA during the trial runs in the Ram Mandir prior to the first Surya Tilak on 17th April 2024.

Through the agreement, TDB has pledged a financial assistance of ₹ 7.5 crores out of the total project cost of ₹ 15 crores, marking a significant stride towards sustainable development and environmental stewardship. The funded project entails the establishment of a commercial plant for the recycling of Li-ion batteries and e-waste, leveraging indigenous technology developed by the Centre for Materials for Electronics Technology (CMET), Hyderabad. Recognized as a matter of national significance, the efficient recycling of Li-ion batteries serves as a vital source of secondary raw materials for cell manufacturing within the country. The escalating imports of e-waste stemming from the disposal of spent Lithium-ion Batteries (LIBs) are driven by their growing utilization in portable electronics, electric vehicles, and global renewable energy storage systems. However, the disposal of LIBs through landfilling and incineration poses environmental and safety concerns, highlighting the need for recycling initiatives. The potential for value creation through the retrieval of metals from spent LIBs has spurred interest in recycling e-waste generated by these batteries. The lithium-ion battery recycling market size is projected to reach USD 14.89 billion by 2030, with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 21.6%, up from USD 3.79 billion in 2021. Despite this, a significant 95% of Li-ion batteries currently end up in landfills, while only 5% undergo recycling and reuse. The dominance of the informal sector in the e-waste scenario has adverse environmental and economic implications. Efficient and environmentally friendly recycling methods are imperative to address the escalating issue of battery waste, mitigate migrant supply side risks related to critical elements, and reduce carbon footprints. Speaking on the occasion, Shri Rajesh Kumar Pathak, Secretary, TDB, said, “India is 3rd in the world in terms of e-waste generation and significant efforts are required to curb the issue.

For the month of February 2024, the Quick Estimates of Index of Industrial Production (IIP) with base 2011-12 stands at 147.2. The Indices of Industrial Production for the Mining, Manufacturing and Electricity sectors for the month of February 2024 stand at 139.6, 144.5 and 187.1 respectively. These Quick Estimates will undergo revision in subsequent releases as per the revision policy of IIP. As per Use-based classification, the indices stand at 148.2 for Primary Goods, 106.2 for Capital Goods, 158.9 for Intermediate Goods and 179.8 for Infrastructure/ Construction Goods for the month of February 2024. Further, the indices for Consumer durables and Consumer non-durables stand at 121.6 and 148.9 respectively for the month of February 2024. Details of Quick Estimates of the Index of Industrial Production for the month of February 2024 at Sectoral, 2-digit level of National Industrial Classification (NIC-2008) and by Use-based classification are given at Statements I, II and III respectively. Also, for users to appreciate the changes in the industrial sector, Statement IV provides month-wise indices for the last 12 months, by industry groups (as per 2-digit level of NIC-2008) and sectors. Along with the Quick Estimates of IIP for the month of February 2024, the indices for January 2024 have undergone the first revision and those for November 2023 have undergone final revision in the light of the updated data received from the source agencies. The Quick Estimates for February 2024, the first revision for January 2024 and the final revision for November 2023 have been compiled at weighted response rates of 93 percent, 95 percent and 96 percent respectively. Release of the Index for March 2024 will be on Friday, 10th May 2024.

A. Suresh Babu, Distinguished Scientist and Director (HR), NPCIL]\\nThe report attempts to answer key questions related to India’s energy trajectory such as how much energy does India need to achieve high value of Human Development Index (HDI); what are pathways to achieve this; what are the energy mix projections for this until 2070 (our declared net-zero target year); what would be the cost of electricity to the end user; what would be the carbon emissions until 2070; what would be the investments required for energy transitions towards net-zero at 2070; estimation of other challenges and opportunities (RE integration, requirement of critical minerals, Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage (CCUS), natural gas, ethanol, hydrogen) in energy transitions towards achieving net-zero in 2070. The main conclusions of the report are given below:\\nProf. Ajay Sood, PSA to Government of India, in his opening remarks, stated that the report is a comprehensive study, bringing together aspects from all sectors of power generation in one place, providing a holistic view of the Indian energy sector and throwing light on the potential pathways for a development-led transition to net-zero. He added that these pathways also need large resources to be put in place, hence, we need to synergise our efforts in various sectors. He stated that this report is a good beginning and more such studies are needed. Dr. Anil Kakodkar, former Chairman, AEC welcomed the study as the need of the hour which is an energy transitions study done from India’s perspective. He also highlighted the need for the development of technologies for low-cost hydrogen production. Dr. V. K. Saraswat, Member, NITI Aayog expressed his satisfaction in the findings of the study which were in alignment with the simulation studies done by NITI Aayog. He appreciated that the study is based on a development-led approach which is the right approach to clean energy transition. He also acknowledged that such a transition is also going to be expensive, as highlighted in the report. He agreed with the premise that more RE penetration is needed with baseload energy source as nuclear. He emphasised that without nuclear energy, the storage requirements for RE will be very high to tackle the intermittency of its supply. This will, in turn, enhance the dependence on critical minerals which is not sustainable. He further added that for the nuclear sector, a transition is needed from large reactors to Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), with participation of industry. There is also a need to promote alternate nuclear fuel options such as Thorium to reduce dependence on Uranium import. Dr.'),\n",

Forests are life givers. The reality is that forests have preserved life on earth, said the President of India, Smt Droupadi Murmu while addressing the officer trainees of Indian Forest Service (2022 batch) at their convocation ceremony at the Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy, Dehradun today (April 24, 2024). The President said that today we talk about the Anthropocene Age, which is the period of human-centric development. During this period, disastrous results have emerged along with development. Unsustainable exploitation of resources has brought humanity to a point where the standards of development have to be re-evaluated. She stressed on the importance of understanding that we are not the owners of the earth's resources, but we are trustees. Our priorities should be ecocentric along with anthropocentric. In fact, only by being ecocentric we will be able to be truly anthropocentric, she stated. The President said that in many parts of the world the loss of forest resources has occurred very rapidly. Destruction of forests is in a way - destruction of humanity. It is a well known fact that conservation of earth's biodiversity and natural beauty is a very important task which we have to do very quickly. The President said that human life can be saved from the crisis through conservation and promotion of forests and wildlife. We can repair the damage at a faster pace with the help of Science and Technology. For example, the Miyawaki Method is being adopted in many places. Artificial Intelligence can help in identifying suitable areas for afforestation and area specific tree species. She stated that there is a need to assess various such options and develop solutions suitable to the geographical conditions of India. The President said that the chariot of development has two wheels – tradition and modernity. Today human society is bearing the brunt of many environmental problems. One of the main reasons for this is a special type of modernity, the root of which is the exploitation of nature. Traditional knowledge is neglected in this process. The President said that tribal society has made the eternal laws of nature the basis of their life. People of this society conserve nature. But, under the impulse of unbalanced modernity, some people consider the tribal community and their collective wisdom primitive. Tribal society has no role in climate change but the burden of its ill effects is disproportionately more on them. The President said that it is very important to understand the importance of the knowledge accumulated by tribal society over centuries and use it to improve the environment. She stated that their collective wisdom can help us move forward on an ecologically sustainable, ethically desirable and socially justifiable path. She stressed that we will have to unlearn many misconceptions and relearn from the ideals of a balanced lifestyle of the tribal society. We have to move forward with the spirit of climate justice. The President said that the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries increased the demand for timber and other forest products. New rules, regulations and methods of forest use were adopted to cope with the demand. To implement such rules and regulations, the Imperial Forest Service, the predecessor service of the Indian Forest Service, was formed. The mandate of that service was not to protect the tribal society and forest wealth. Their mandate was to promote the objectives of the British Raj by exploiting India's forest resources to the maximum. Referring to the mass hunting of wild animals during the British period, the President said that when she visits museums where animal skins or severed heads adorn the walls, she feels that those exhibits are telling the story of the decline of human civilization. The President said that she was confident that the officers of the Indian Forest Service had become completely free from the colonial mentality and outlook of the former Imperial Forest Service. She stated that IFS officers not only have to conserve and augment India's natural resources but also use the traditional knowledge in the interest of humanity. They have to protect the forest wealth by synchronizing modernity and tradition and advancing the interests of the people whose life is based on forests. By doing this, they will be able to make a contribution that is truly inclusive and congenial to the environment. The President said that the Indian Forest Service has given many officers to the country who have done unparalleled work for the environment. IFS officers such as Shri P.\"),\n",

She stated that the role of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics will continue to increase in diagnostics and treatment. She expressed confidence that these changes will be increasingly put to efficient use by the AIIMS Rishikesh. The President said that in Uttarakhand, due to lack of sunlight and local food habits, people, especially women, are affected by diseases like osteoporosis and anemia. She stated that even in this era of global medicine, researching and solving national, regional and local problems related to medicine should be the priority of institutions like AIIMS Rishikesh. She urged AIIMS Rishikesh to pay maximum attention to public health and community engagement.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that\\xa0the launch of India’s first gene therapy is a major breakthrough in our battle against cancer. As this line of treatment, named “CAR-T cell therapy”, is accessible and affordable, it provides a new hope for the whole of humankind. She expressed confidence that it will be successful in giving new lives to countless patients. The President said that CAR-T cell therapy is considered to be one of the most phenomenal advances in medical science. It has been available in the developed nations for some time, but it is extremely costly, and beyond the reach of most patients around the world. She was happy to note that the therapy being launched today is the world’s most affordable CAR-T cell therapy. She said that it is also an example of the ‘Make in India’ initiative; a shining example of the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’. The President was happy to note that India’s first CAR-T cell therapy is developed through collaboration between the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay and Tata Memorial Hospital in association with industry partner ImmunoACT. She said that this is a praiseworthy example of academia-industry partnership, which should inspire many more similar efforts. The President said that IIT Bombay is renowned, not only in India but across the world, as a model of technology education. In the development of CAR-T cell therapy, technology is not only being put in the service of humanity, but partnerships have been with an eminent institution from another field as well as with industry. This has been made possible by the focus IIT, Bombay has placed on research and development over the last three decades. She said that with the knowledge base and skills of the faculty and students of IIT Bombay and other similar institutions, India as a whole, would benefit greatly from the technological revolution underway.

RBI has completed its 90 years. As an institution, RBI has been a witness to both pre-independence and post-independence eras. Today, RBI's recognition worldwide is attributed to its professionalism and commitment. I extend my congratulations to all the employees and officers of the Reserve Bank of India on the 90 years since its establishment. Furthermore, I consider those who are associated with RBI at this time to be very fortunate. The policies you formulate today, the work you do, will determine the direction of RBI for the next decade. This decade will take this institution to its centenary year. And this decade is equally crucial for the ‘Sankalp Yatra’ of a ‘Viksit Bharat’. And for that, as your mantra suggests - while giving top priority to RBI's rapid growth, it is equally important to focus on trust and stability. I extend best wishes to RBI for its objectives and resolutions as well. Friends,\\nYou are experts in your respective fields. You know that the country's economy and GDP largely depends on the coordination of monetary and fiscal policies. I remember when I participated in the Reserve Bank's '80th' year program in 2014, the situation was entirely different. The entire banking sector of Bharat was grappling with problems and challenges. Concerns about the stability of Bharat’s banking system and its future were widespread, especially regarding non-performing assets (NPAs). The situation was so dire that public sector banks were not able to contribute significantly to the country's economic progress. We all started from there. And look, today Bharat’s banking system is considered a strong and sustainable system in the world. The banking system, which was once on the verge of sinking, is now making profits and showing record growth in credit. Friends,\\nYou also know that such a significant change in just 10 years was not easy. This change came because there was clarity in our policies, intentions, and decisions. This change came because there was determination and honesty in our efforts. Today, the country is witnessing that when intentions are right, policies are also right. When policies are right, decisions are also right. And when decisions are right, the results are also right. In short, what I want to say is - when intentions are right, results are right. How the country's banking system transformed is in itself a subject of study. There wasn't any stone left unturned. Our government worked on the policy of 'recognition', 'resolution', and 'recapitalization'. To improve the condition of public sector banks, the government infused nearly 3.5 lakh crore rupees of capital and implemented several governance-related reforms. The new framework of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code alone resolved close to 3.25 lakh crore rupees worth of loans. And one figure that the citizens must know is that more than 27,000 applications, with underlying defaults of over 9 lakh crore rupees, were resolved even before admission into the IBC. This demonstrates the effectiveness of this new system. The gross NPA of banks, which was around 11% in 2018, has decreased to less than 3% by September 2023. Today, the problem of the Twin Balance Sheet is now a part of the past. Today, banks' credit growth has reached up to 15 per cent. In all these achievements, the RBI has played a significant role as a partner and its efforts are commendable. Friends,\\nDiscussion about institutions like the RBI often remains confined to financial definitions and complex terminologies. It's natural given the intricacies of your work. However, the work you do directly impacts the lives of ordinary citizens. Over the past 10 years, we have highlighted this connection between the central bank, the banking system, and the common person at the grassroots level. Financial inclusion for the poor is a significant example today. We have 52 crore Jan Dhan accounts in the country, with over 55% of these accounts held in the name of women. The impact of this financial inclusion can also be seen in sectors like agriculture and fisheries. Today, more than 7 crore farmers, fishermen, and livestock owners have farmer credit cards. This has given a significant boost to our rural economy. The cooperative sector has also received a major boost in the past 10 years. Cooperatives play a crucial role in the cooperative banking sector, which is also an important area of regulation and supervision for the Reserve Bank. The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has now become a globally recognized platform. It processes more than 1200 crore transactions every month. Now you are also working on Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). This is also a snapshot of the transformation that has taken place in the last 10 years. Within a decade, we have entered into a completely new banking system, a new economy, and a new currency experience. And as I mentioned earlier, what has happened in the last 10 years is just the trailer. There is still much to do, we have to take the country much further ahead. Friends,\\nIt is crucial that we have clear goals for the next 10 years. We need to work together to expand the possibilities of digital transactions in the next decade. We also need to keep an eye on the changes coming from the shift towards a cashless economy. We must also strive to improve financial inclusion and empowerment efforts further. Friends,\\nThe banking needs of such a large population can indeed vary widely. Some people prefer the traditional physical branch model, while others prefer digital delivery. It is essential to formulate policies that improve the ease of banking and provide credit access according to everyone's needs. To make Bharat a leader in the field of Digital Payments Infrastructure (DPI), we need to continuously leverage Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. The Reserve Bank must continue to take consistent steps for Bharat’s progress to be rapid, inclusive, and sustainable. As a regulator, the RBI has ensured rule-based discipline and financially prudent practices in the banking sector. However, it is also essential for the RBI to anticipate the future needs of various sectors, prepare in advance, and encourage banks to take proactive steps while assessing their requirements. I assure you that the government stands with you. You may recall that dealing with double-digit inflation was not reflected in financial policies ten years ago. To address this challenge, our government entrusted the Reserve Bank of India with the authority of inflation targeting. The Monetary Policy Committee has done an excellent job in fulfilling this mandate. Additionally, the government has taken steps such as active price monitoring and fiscal consolidation. Therefore, despite the COVID crisis, situations of war in different countries, and tensions, inflation in Bharat has remained at a moderate level. Friends,\\nA country with clear priorities cannot be stopped from progressing. During the COVID crisis, we prioritized financial prudence while also giving top priority to the lives of ordinary citizens. That's why Bharat’s poor and middle class are now driving the economy forward despite the crisis. While many of the world's largest economies are still struggling to recover from the shock, the Indian economy is setting new records. The RBI can take Bharat’s success to the global level. Balancing inflation control and growth is a unique challenge for any developing country. It is essential to think about which monetary tools can be used to address this challenge. The RBI can play a global leadership role by serving as a model for this approach. I say this based on ten years of experience, and after closely observing and understanding the world. This could greatly benefit the entire Global South. Friends,\\nWhile setting targets for the next 10 years, we must also consider the aspirations of Bharat’s youth. Bharat is one of the youngest countries in the world today. RBI has a vital role in fulfilling the youth’s aspirations. Over the past 10 years, new sectors have emerged due to government policies, providing new opportunities for the country's youth. We can see expansion in emerging sectors such as green energy today. The government is promoting sectors like solar energy and green hydrogen. There's been consistent growth in ethanol blending in the country. Bharat has emerged as a prime player in digital technology, and efforts have been made towards indigenous 5G technology. Additionally, we are playing a significant role as a defence sector exporter. MSMEs are the backbone of the Indian economy and the manufacturing sector. All these sectors require different types of financing, and during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Credit Guarantee Scheme for MSMEs provided a significant boost to this sector. The Reserve Bank also needs to think about out-of-the-box policies going forward. And I have seen that our Shaktikanta ji is an expert in thinking out of the box. And I am happy that most applause was reserved for this statement. It is very important to ensure that our youth get adequate credit availability, especially in new sectors. Friends,\\nInnovation will play an important role in the 21st century. The government is making record investments in innovation. As you have seen we have allocated a research fund of 1 lakh crore rupees for innovation in the recent interim budget. It is essential to think about how we can prepare those who want to work in the field of cutting-edge technology, considering the proposals that come in. RBI should also start thinking about how it will assist them. We need to identify such individuals and create teams. We should develop expertise in both traditional businesses and upcoming subjects. Similarly, the space sector is opening up, with new start-ups emerging. We need to see what kind of support they need for credit. Similarly, one of the largest sectors emerging in Bharat with full force is the tourism sector. The tourism sector is growing, and the whole world wants to come to Bharat, see Bharat, and understand Bharat. I read somewhere that tourism experts have said that in the coming years, Ayodhya will become the world's largest capital in religious tourism. We need to see our preparations to financially support this sector.\"),\n",

I am busy with elections for the next 100 days, so you have plenty of time to think, because there will be a lot of work to do right from the second day after taking the oath. Friends,\\nWe have done a lot of work on financial inclusion and digital payments. As a result, the financial capacity of our small businesses and street vendors is now transparently visible. Now, using this information, we need to financially empower them. Friends,\\nWe need to work together to further enhance Bharat’s economic self-reliance over the next 10 years. We should ensure that our economy is least affected by global crises. Today, Bharat is becoming an engine of global growth with a 15 per cent share in global GDP growth. In these circumstances, efforts should be made to make our currency more accessible and acceptable worldwide. Another trend that has been observed globally in recent years is excessive economic expansion and increasing debt. The private sector debt of many countries has reached up to double their GDP. The debt level of several countries not only affects those countries but also impacts the entire global economy. The Reserve Bank should conduct a study on this matter. Considering the prospects and potential of Bharat’s growth, it is essential to determine how much credit availability should be there and how it should be managed sustainably in a modern context. Friends,\\nIt will be equally important for our banking industry to advance in order to fund essential projects for the country. Amidst this necessity, there are also challenges on many fronts today. New technologies like AI and BlockChain have transformed banking methods, changing the entire approach. The role of cyber security has become crucial in the rising era of digital banking. Innovations in fintech are creating new avenues for banking. In such circumstances, we need to think about the necessary changes in the structure of the country's banking sector. This may require new financing, operating, and business models. From the credit needs of global champions to the requirements of street vendors, from cutting-edge sectors to traditional sectors, fulfilling these needs is crucial for the ‘Viksit Bharat’. The Reserve Bank is a very appropriate institution for this entire study of the banking vision for a ‘Viksit Bharat’. Your efforts will be crucial for the development of a ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047. Once again, my best wishes to all of you. Thank you! ***\\nDS/RT/VK\\n\"),\n",

Revered Shri Pragyasagarji Muniraj, revered Upadhyay Shri Ravindra Muni ji Maharaj Sahib, revered Sadhvi Shri Sulakshanashriji Maharaj Sahib, revered Sadhvi Shri Animashriji Maharaj Sahib, my colleagues in the government, Arjun Ram Meghwal ji and Smt. Meenakshi Lekhi ji, all the respected saints, brothers and sisters! This magnificent building of Bharat Mandapam is witnessing the beginning of the 2550th Nirvana Mahotsav of Lord Mahavir today. We have just seen the depiction prepared by student friends on the life of Lord Mahavir! The young companions also presented the 'Vartaman Mein Vardhman' cultural program. This attraction and dedication of the young generation towards our timeless values, towards Lord Mahavir, instils the belief that the country is heading in the right direction. On this historic occasion, I also have the privilege to release special postage stamps and coins. This event has been made possible especially with the guidance and blessings of our Jain saints and sadhvis. And therefore, I bow to all of you. I extend my greetings to all the citizens of the country on this holy occasion of Mahavir Jayanti. You all know participating in such virtuous programs amidst the hustle and bustle of elections greatly soothes the mind. Respected saints, it is natural for me today to remember the great spiritual leader Acharya Shri 108 Vidyasagarji\\xa0 Maharaj on this occasion. Just last year, I had the opportunity to meet him at the Chandragiri Temple in Chhattisgarh. Though his physical body may not be among us, his blessings are certainly with us. Friends,\\nThis 2550th Nirvana Mahotsav of Lord Mahavir is a rare occasion of thousands of years. Such occasions, naturally, bring together many special coincidences. This is the time when Bharat is in the early phase of the ‘Amrit Kaal’. The country is working towards making the centenary year of independence into a golden centenary. This year, our Constitution is also nearing 75 years. At the same time, a grand democratic festival is underway in the country. The nation believes that from here, the new journey of the future will begin. Amidst all these coincidences, today we are all gathered here together. And you must have understood what it means to be present together? My connection with you all is very old. Everybody has his own world. Brothers and sisters,\\nThe concept of ‘Amrit Kaal’ for the nation is not just a grand resolution; it is Bharat’s spiritual inspiration that teaches us to live immortality and eternity. Even 2500 years later, we are celebrating the Nirvana Day of Lord Mahavir today. And we know that even thousands of years later, this country will continue to celebrate such festivals connected with Lord Mahavir. The ability to think in centuries and millennia... this visionary and far-reaching thinking... that's why Bharat is not only the world's oldest living civilization, but also a secure haven for humanity. This is Bharat that thinks not just for 'self' but for 'all'. This is Bharat that doesn't feel just 'own' but feels 'universal'. This is Bharat that thinks not of 'ego' but 'we'. This is Bharat that believes not in 'limits' but in 'boundlessness'. This is Bharat that talks of policy, talks of 'neti' (not this) and talks of 'neti' (not that). This is Bharat that talks about the universe in the atom, talks about the Divine in the universe, talks about Shiva in the soul. Friends,\\nIn every era, new ideas emerge according to the needs. However, when there is stagnation in ideas, thoughts turn into arguments, and arguments turn into disputes. But when nectar emerges from disputes and we walk with the support of nectar, then we move forward towards rejuvenation. However, if poison emerges from disputes, then we sow the seeds of destruction at every moment. For the 75 years since independence, we have debated, argued, and held dialogues, and what has emerged from this churn after 75 years, now it is our responsibility to take that nectar, liberate ourselves from poison, and live this era of ‘Amrit Kaal’. Amidst global conflicts, countries are becoming war-weary. In such times, the teachings of our Tirthankaras have become even more important. They have provided philosophies like Anekantavada and Syadvada to save humanity from arguments and disputes. Anekantavada means understanding multiple aspects of a subject, being open to seeing and accepting others' perspectives. Such a liberating interpretation of faith is the uniqueness of Bharat, and this is the message of humanity from Bharat. Friends,\\nToday, amidst conflicts, the world is looking to Bharat for peace. The credit for this new role of the new Bharat is attributed to our growing capabilities and foreign policy. But I want to tell you that our cultural image has a significant contribution to this. Today, Bharat has got this role because we uphold vows like truth and non-violence on global platforms with full confidence. We tell the world that the solution to global crises and conflicts lies in Bharat’s ancient culture and tradition. Therefore, Bharat is carving out its place as a 'Vishwa Bandhu’ (friend of world) for the divided world. For solutions to crises like 'climate change,' today Bharat has laid the foundation for global movements like 'Mission LiFE.' Today, Bharat has presented the vision of One Earth, One Family, One Future to the world. For clean energy and sustainable development, we have provided a roadmap for One-World, One-Sun, One-Grid. Today, we are leading futuristic global initiatives like the International Solar Alliance. Our efforts have not only instilled hope in the world but have also changed the world's perspective on Bharat’s ancient culture. Friends,\\nThe essence of Jainism is the path of victory, meaning the path of conquering oneself. We have never resorted to aggression to conquer other countries. We have achieved victory by reforming ourselves and overcoming our shortcomings. Therefore, some sage, some wise person has appeared in every era to guide us during difficult times. Great civilizations were destroyed, but Bharat found its way. Brothers and sisters,\\nYou must remember what kind of atmosphere prevailed in our country just 10 years ago. There was all-round despair and hopelessness! It was believed that nothing could happen to this country! This despair was equally troubling for Indian culture. Therefore, after 2014, along with physical development, we also took a resolution of pride in our heritage. Today, we are celebrating the 2550th Nirvana Mahotsav of Lord Mahavir. In these 10 years, we have celebrated many such significant occasions. Whenever our Jain Acharyas have invited me, I have made an effort to participate in those programs as well. Before entering the new building of Parliament, I remember these values by saying 'Micchami Dukkadam.' Similarly, we have started to preserve our heritage. We have talked about yoga and Ayurveda. Today, the new generation of the country believes that our identity is our pride. When the feeling of pride awakens in the nation, it becomes impossible to stop it. The progress of Bharat is evidence of this. Friends,\\nFor Bharat, modernity is the body, spirituality is its soul. If spirituality is removed from modernity, then it gives birth to lawlessness. And if there is no sacrifice in behaviour, even the greatest of ideologies become distorted. This is the perspective that Lord Mahavir gave us centuries ago. Reviving these values in society is the demand of the time. Brothers and sisters,\\nOur country has also endured the agony of corruption for many decades. We have witnessed the deep suffering of poverty. Today, the nation has reached a point where we have lifted 250 million people out of the quagmire of poverty. You will remember, I said from the Red Fort, and Pujya Maharaj also reiterated - this is the time, the right time. This is the right time for us to strengthen the ideals of ‘Asteya’ and ‘Ahimsa’ in our society. I assure all you saints that the country will continue its efforts in this direction. I also believe that your support in the journey of building the future of Bharat will strengthen the nation's aspirations and make Bharat ‘Viksit’ (prosperous). The blessings of Lord Mahavir will ensure the welfare of 1.4 billion citizens and the entire human race... And I respectfully bow to all the revered saints. In a way, pearls were appearing in their speeches. Whether it was about women empowerment, the journey of development, or the great traditions, all the revered saints have presented what is happening in current systems, and what should happen, in a very short time and in a very wonderful manner. I express my heartfelt gratitude to them for this, and I consider each of their words as a blessing. They are my invaluable treasure, and each of their words is an inspiration for the country. This is my conviction. If perhaps it weren't an election atmosphere, maybe I would have been in a different mood. But I have made every effort to keep those things aside and come here. I might not have brought them, but you have definitely brought them. But for all of this, no matter how hot it gets, don't wait for the heat to reduce before stepping out of the house. Come out early in the morning, and there is a direct connection with the lotus, with all our saints, mahants, and divine beings. I am very pleased to be among all of you, and with this sentiment, I bow down once again at the feet of Lord Mahavir. I bow down to all you saints. Thank you very much!

Addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister extended a warm welcome to all the dignitaries and said that their participation would strengthen the global discourse and decisions on the important issue of Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. Reflecting on the impressive growth of the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure since its inception in 2019, the Prime Minister underlined that it is now a global coalition of 39 countries and 7 organizations. “This is a good sign for the future”, he added. Noting the growing frequency and severity of natural disasters where the damage caused is usually evaluated in dollars, the Prime Minister highlighted that its true impact on people, families and communities is beyond numbers. Shri Modi drew attention to the impact of natural disasters on humans and mentioned earthquakes destroying houses making thousands of people homeless and natural disasters disrupting water and sewage systems putting people’s health at risk. He also touched upon natural disasters that can impact energy plants leading to potentially dangerous situations. The Prime Minister emphasized, “We must invest in resilient infrastructure today for a better tomorrow.” He stressed that resilience must be factored into new infrastructure creation while also being a part of post-disaster rebuilding. The Prime Minister pointed out that the focus should shift towards resilience in infrastructure once relief and rehabilitation are carried out after a disaster strikes. Underlining that nature and disasters have no borders, the Prime Minister said that disasters and disruptions cause widespread impact in a highly interconnected world. “The world can be resilient collectively, only when each country is resilient individually”, PM Modi said. He stressed the importance of shared resilience due to shared risks and said that CDRI and this conference will help the world come together for this collective mission. “To achieve shared resilience, we must support the most vulnerable”, the Prime Minister remarked. Referring to the Small Island Developing States at high risk of disasters, Prime Minister Modi mentioned a CDRI program for funding projects across 13 such places. He gave examples of resilient housing in Dominica, resilient transport networks in Papua New Guinea, and enhanced early warning systems in the Dominican Republic and Fiji. He expressed satisfaction that CDRI also has a focus on the Global South. The Prime Minister recalled the formation of a new Disaster Risk Reduction Working Group with financing at the heart of its discussions during India’s G20 Presidency and said that such steps will take the world to a resilient future along with the growth of CDRI. He concluded his address by expressing confidence about the fruitful deliberations at ICDRI over the next two days.

The Prime Minister also conveyed his best wishes for the fulfilment of its goals and resolutions. Emphasizing the importance of coordination of monetary and fiscal policies in the GDP and the economy of the country, the Prime Minister recalled the 80-year celebration of RBI in 2014 and remembered the challenges and problems like NPA and stability faced by the banking system of the country at that time. He said that starting from there, today we have reached a point where the Indian banking system is being seen as a strong and sustainable banking system of the world as the near moribund banking system of that time is now in profit and showing record credit. The Prime Minister credited clarity of policy, intentions and decisions for this transformation. “Where intentions are right, results too are correct”, said the Prime Minister. Speaking on the comprehensive nature of reforms, the Prime Minister stated that the government worked on the strategy of recognition, resolution and recapitalization. A capital infusion of 3.5 lakh crore was undertaken for the helping public sector banks along with many governance-related reforms. Just the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code has resolved loans amounting to 3.25 lakh rupees, the Prime Minister pointed out. He also informed the country that more than 27,000 applications involving underlying defaults of more than Rs 9 lakh crore were resolved even before admission under IBC. Gross NPAs of banks that stood at 11.25 percent in 2018 came down to below 3 percent by September 2023. He said that the problem of twin balance sheets is a problem of the past. PM Modi complimented RBI for their contribution to this transformation.

The Prime Minister also touched upon the work being done on Central Bank Digital Currency and said that the transformations of the past 10 years have enabled the creation of a new banking system, economy and currency experience. The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of clarity for the targets of the next 10 years. He pointed out the importance of keeping an eye on the changes brought about by the cashless economy while promoting digital transactions. He also stressed the need for deepening financial inclusion and empowerment processes. Stressing the diverse banking needs of a large country like India, the Prime Minister underlined the need to improve ‘ease of doing banking’ and provide tailor-made services as per the needs of the citizens. He underscored the role of artificial intelligence and machine learning. He highlighted the role of RBI in speedy and sustainable growth of the country. Noting the achievement of RBI in infusing rule-based discipline and fiscally prudent policies in the banking sector, the Prime Minister also asked for advance estimation of the needs of various sectors to take proactive steps while assuring the banks of government’s support. The Prime Minister also mentioned inflation-controlling measures like giving the right of inflation targeting to the RBI and praised the performance of the Monetary Policy Committee in this regard. Steps like active price monitoring and fiscal consolidation kept inflation at a moderate level even during difficult times of Corona. “Nobody can stop a country from progressing if its priorities are clear”, the Prime Minister emphasized. He gave the example of the government giving heed to financial prudence and prioritizing the lives of common citizens during the covid pandemic which led to the poor and middle class emerging out of the adversity and giving momentum to the country’s growth today. “The Indian economy is creating new records at a time when many countries in the world are still trying to recover from the economic shock of the pandemic”, the Prime Minister said. He underlined the role of RBI in taking India’s successes to the global level. Highlighting the importance of creating a balance between inflation control and growth for any developing country, PM Modi expressed confidence that RBI can become a model for this and play a leadership role in the world, thereby supporting the entire global south region. Noting that India is the most youthful nation in the world today, the Prime Minister touched upon RBI playing a critical role in fulfilling the aspirations of the youth. He credited the policies of the government in the opening up of new sectors in the country thereby creating numerous opportunities for the youth of today.

The Prime Minister said that India is emerging from the period of corruption and despair as more than 25 crore Indians have come out of poverty. Asking the citizens to seize the moment, the Prime Minister asked everyone to follow the path of ‘Asteya and Ahimsa’ and reiterated his commitment to keep working for the future of the nation and thanked the Saints for their inspiring words.

I extend a warm welcome to India to all of you. It is great to have you with us at the 6th edition of the International Conference on Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. Your participation will strengthen the global discourse and decisions on this important issue. Friends,\\nIn the last few years, the growth of the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure has been impressive. We have come a long way since 2019, when CDRI was launched. It is now a global coalition of 39 countries and 7 organizations. This is a good sign for the future. Friends,\\nAs we all have witnessed, natural disasters are becoming more frequent and more severe. The damage they cause is usually reported in dollars. But their true impact on people, families and communities is beyond just numbers. Earthquakes destroy houses, making thousands of people homeless. Natural disasters can disrupt water and sewage systems, putting the health of people at risk. Some disasters can impact energy plants, leading to potentially dangerous situations. These things have a human impact. Friends,\\nWe must invest in resilient infrastructure today, for a better tomorrow. Resilience needs to be factored into new infrastructure creation. Further, it also needs to be a part of post-disaster rebuilding. After disasters, the immediate focus is naturally on relief and rehabilitation. After the initial response, our focus should also include resilience of infrastructure. Friends,\\nNature and disasters have no borders. In a highly interconnected world, disasters and disruptions cause widespread impact. The world can be resilient collectively, only when each country is resilient individually. Shared resilience is important because of the shared risks. CDRI and this conference help us come together for this collective mission. Friends,\\nTo achieve shared resilience, we must support the most vulnerable. For example, Small Island Developing States are at high risk of disasters. CDRI has a programme which is funding projects across 13 such places. Resilient housing in Dominica, Resilient transport networks in Papua New Guinea, and Enhanced early warning systems in the Dominican Republic and Fiji are some examples. It is heartening that CDRI also has a focus on the Global South. Friends,\\nDuring India’s G20 Presidency, an important step was taken. A new Disaster Risk Reduction Working Group was formed with financing at the heart of the discussions. Along with the growth of CDRI, such steps will take the world to a resilient future. I am sure that the next two days will see fruitful deliberations at ICDRI. Thank You.'),\n",

Lauding these steps for bringing unprecedented transparency and accountability within the system now, he said that this aligns with the new norm of zero-tolerance to corruption in Bharat today. Power corridors have been duly neutralized of corrupt elements and corruption is no longer a passport to opportunity, it is sure passage to jail, he asserted. I recall my days when I was on a visit to the USA in 1988 along with my wife.

Referring to certain individuals casting doubts over India’s growth trajectory, he remarked, “There are skeptics outside and inside, trying to occupy public space. My message to them - step out of “bubble” to experience the environment of hope & possibility.” VP also added that such individuals will be enlightened once they get out of that bubble and if they don't, it is the duty of citizens to “burst the bubble.”\\nFriends,This is a different Bharat - the fastest growing major economy in the world!There are skeptics outside and inside, trying to occupy public space.

Praising the Indian Revenue Service’s pivotal role as the custodian of our taxation system, VP asked them to “empower taxpayers with information, foster trust through transparency, uphold the highest standards of integrity in your professional conduct.” Describing civil servants as the natural role models for the youth, he told the young officers that “you are required to exemplify by conduct discipline, integrity, humility, ethics and sense of commitment. You must be inspirational and motivational for young minds all over the country.”\\nShri Ramesh Bais, Governor of Maharashtra, Shri Nitin Gupta, CBDT Chairman, Shri Seemanchal Das, Principal Director General Training, Shri P.C.

Emphasizing the significance of innovation in medicine development, he asserted that R&D efforts transcend mere execution, embodying the highest form of contribution to humanity. \"Our pursuit to serve humanity by science and research should not be hampered by temporary failures\", he added. He further highlighted India’s contribution to international vaccine efforts, including the donation of Covaxin through the vaccine Matri initiative, reflecting India\\'s long standing contribution to the principle of \"Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam\". Shri Dhankhar further emphasized the need for corporates leaders to handhold institutions to promote research and development to foster innovation, with focus on disruptive technologies. Addressing the gathering at the Bharat Biotech facility in Hyderabad, Shri Dhankhar lauded the heightened credibility of Padma Awards in recent times. The Vice President asserted that Padma Awards are now very authentic, being given to the deserving persons. “They are no longer driven by patronage or reputations build by event management” he added. Addressing the economic concerns at Bharat Biotech, Shri Dhankhar highlighted the significant drain of foreign exchange due to unnecessary imports. Criticizing this practice as contradictory to the ethos of promoting local products and societal commitment, he warned people of three serious consequences: the avoidable depletion of foreign exchange reserves, the hindrance to domestic manufacturing by importing goods available locally, and the suppression of entrepreneurial opportunities. Underlining that many of the world\\'s top institutions draw their strength from their large alumni base, Shri Dhankhar urged the alumni to come forward and form a strong alumni network through think tanks, contributing to the growth and development of the nation. Advocating for channelization of disruptive technologies, Vice President underscored their transformative potential, cautioning against their unregulated proliferation. He further stated that India\\'s unwavering dedication to biotechnology and Pharmaceutical research has led to build its reputation as the pharmacy of the world. The Vice-President declared Bharat\\'s ascent as a superpower, citing the nation\\'s rapid progression and dynamic momentum. With confidence in Bharat\\'s future, he emphasizes the transformative shift from a sleeping giant to a fast-moving force. Shri C.P.

Shri Dhankhar also expressed the need for increased usage of digital technologies in preservation of precious ancient manuscripts. Describing Sanskrit as the treasure house of our cultural heritage, the Vice President called its preservation and promotion as a national priority and duty. He also wanted Sanskrit to be developed according to present day needs and its learning made easy.

Stating that studying Sanskrit is not merely an academic pursuit, VP described it as a journey of self-discovery and enlightenment.

This moment marks a stepping stone for your entry into the wider world—a world that is filled with endless possibilities and opportunities. Friend- Bharat today is no longer a nation with just a potential or a sleeping giant. It is on the rise as never before. The rise of Bharat is unstoppable. All this is to your great advantage. You are fortunate as an enabling governance ecosystem and stable economy fundamentals offering you a platform for\\xa0\\xa0unleashing your talent and energy. Perfectsetting for realising your aspirations and dreams. All of you my friend are very lucky to be part of the marathon march towards the goal of Viksit Bharat@2047! Some of us may not be around, but it will be gratifying for everyone to ensure that by 2047, Bharat will be the pinnacle of the world! Friends- A convocation address is an occasion for the speaker to impart guidance and sage advice or suggestions before you all step out from the ivory towers of academia to the real world outside. A decade or so ago such advice or suggestions may been scary or even a nightmare. A speaker in my place\\xa0\\xa0a decade ago would have been worried, What to tell you? What are prospects? Because we then had a worrisomely alarming economic environment. There were fragility all around, A despondent atmosphere but now the contemporaneous situation is soothing and inviting. In a sense there is now 360 degree turn as the national mood is upbeat-reflecting hope and possibility. Each of you present here today is a torchbearer of India's future. When it comes to talent intellect, and knowledge you are one of the best in the world. I encourage you to harness your talents and skills to script new chapters in India’s growth story. And what a remarkable story it is going to be! Always remember, your hot pursuit for success, accolades, organisational and professional growth as leader should not let you forget the importance of humanity and empathy in business. Today you will embark on a new voyage. You will venture out into an industry that unlike a decade ago. The scene a decade ago was very different, you would be losing your sleep.With this degree you would not know where to go but now the situation is very different situation is brimming with opportunities for you. The scenario is full of hope and possibility. My young friends, the national scenario couldn’t be more soothing and inviting. The nation is on the rise and economic trajectory despite global headwinds is continually upwards; national mood is upbeat with our surging global image. You are discerning minds you know what Now means to be Indian outside of India. You know now what's your what it means to the holder of Indian passport, You know more than I do what is the image of our country now and that is something you will relish all your life. Soon to become the third largest global economy ahead of Germany and Japan, we are already global third in purchasing power. And this status of Bharat is more relevant to you and you know what is the potential of purchasing power and in this country we have this population this rich human resource this youthful components the change has to be exponential and geometric. Friends - The world is at the cusp of something like another industrial revolution thanks to onslaught of disruptive technologies. These technologies are a challenge. There are opportunities you will be concerned with them in your future workings\\n\\nBy harnessing the seamless integration of these technologies, organisations can stay competitive in the digital era and shape a future where connectivity, trust, and intelligence drive success. As a matter of fact, reflecting on a few years ago, this was not even a dream. We were not in a position to think about it or imagine it. I know this from experience. I was a Member of Parliament in 1989, and I was a Union Minister then. I had to suffer the pain of witnessing our gold, in solid form, being airlifted to be placed in two banks in Switzerland to sustain our fiscal credibility. Our foreign exchange then was dwindling between 1 billion and 2 billion dollars, and now, see the rise: 6 to 7 billion dollars in a week. It is over 600 billion now. As young leaders in business, trade, commerce and industry, you will have the opportunity to take charge, harness the opportunities that are beyond the obvious and create impact that has the well-being of the society at heart. Happiness and satisfaction do not come with personal wealth being amassed. The greatest satisfaction comes when you have rewarding experience of serving your motherland Bharat and that I am sure you will be engaged in. Look at how far we have come as nation. This journey was not easy. Can you ever imagine 500 million people getting into the banking industry? What could be more inclusive growth than this? Just imagine gas connections in every house, tap water in every house, toilets in every house, and education being available everywhere. Every village has a computer center. You are lucky to have this kind of ecosystem. This allows you full play in joints. You can play with straight bats, realize your ambition, and serve your motherland. Just a decade ago, our economy was fragile. Five economies, the world institutions, were in a punishing mode for us. They used to advise how we handle our affairs and what are transformations. Just in a decade, we march ahead of Canada, UK, and France to be the 5th largest global economy. I have no doubt that by 2047, we will be at the peak or very close to getting at the peak. The World Bank, which used to question us earlier, now praises India for achieving its financial inclusion objectives within an impressively short span of six years, a feat that typically requires nearly five decades to accomplish. This is a tribute to our visionary leadership and fast execution. That is why the nation is experiencing not pyramidical growth, but plateau kind of growth; everyone is rising together in togetherness. Similarly, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has recognized India as a prime destination for investment and growth opportunities. India's inclusive Digital Payment system, which facilitates real-time transactions, has garnered attention worldwide and is being adopted by countries like Singapore. In fact, 46% of the world's total real-time digital transactions now occur in this land. Adaptability accessibility of internet is reflected in the statistics that our per capita internet consumption is more than that of China and USA taken together. In addition to its digital infrastructure, India has made remarkable strides in developing world-class physical infrastructure, thereby enhancing the quality of life for its vast population of 1.4 billion. Recent notable examples you will know Mandapam—a massive convention center, one of the top 10 in the world. We have Yashobhoomi and a new Parliament building, the kinds of roads, airports, and railway stations we have now were beyond our dreams and contemplation a decade ago. It reflects that India has human resources; the genius of its human resources is unrivaled. It needs visionary leadership, leadership that thinks out of the box, leadership that has the capacity to execute. I know for a fact, being chairman in Rajya Sabha, that despite the pandemic, the new parliament building came in 30 months. It was not just a building; it's complete infrastructure that we could hold our sessions there. The world is amazed and stunned at our progress. Friends these achievement underscore our capacity to construct such impressive structures with within remarkably short time frame. Let me give you a small illustration Chandrayaan-2 September 2022 it was to land on the moon I was governor state of West Bengal along with my wife, I went to the Science City the landing was little after midnight around 2:00 a.m. if I am not wrong Chandrayaan-2 reached very close within metres but the landing was not 100% success. How can you call it failure will reach there we reached quiet close the Prime Minister came from the behind to encourage the entire team and we had chandrayaan-3 landing on that part of the moon no one has landed so far. International aeronautical society has acknowledged Shiv-Shakti point on moon which mean the governance is so strong that it does not take failure it takes success. This is a message to you and a lesson to you never avoid taking a jump because you think you may fail I don't suggest you take jumps recklessly think about it but fear should not deter you from trying out. Effective execution of the vision of our leadership would not have been possible without weeding out corruption. There was a time when corruption was visible in every facet of life: a job, a contract, an opportunity—you could not avail without taking recourse to those who were corrupt. Corruption was your password to getting opportunity or relief; the power corridors were infested with corrupt elements who extra-legally leveraged decision-making. A decade ago, we had spectacles to see in the public domain, even ministerial berths, prerogatives of those in executive authority, were considered and decided elsewhere. But now, power corridors have been duly sanitized of corrupt elements. Across various frontiers of cutting-edge technology, including quantum computing, machine learning, 6G technology, and green hydrogen, India is prominently positioned as a front runner. These new vistas are gold mine opportunities for you all. Today, as the world is in a state of flux, change is the only constant. The rapid advancements in technology have ushered in a new era, creating a surge in demand for professionals who can harness these developments to drive their organization's business goals forward. Whether it's artificial intelligence, machine learning, or analytics, the opportunities are limitless for those who are willing to embrace innovation and adapt to change. In such a scenario of dynamism and volatility, your core values will be your Guide,\\xa0\\xa0keeping you anchored ever as you stride ahead! So gear up to bring about the change you believe in. During my time even if I believed in a change I would be in a state of hopelessness because I know I could not bring about it now you can bring it about. Look at the start-ups and unicorns these have emanated from minds like you. Most of you are poised to carve out your niches in the business world. Remember, friends: ethical leadership and that is part of your oath this is not negotiable if you compromise on ethics then you can't be winner of the kind that the world you salute you will be leaving inside silo because you compromised ethical standards. Temptations will be amazing like taking shortcut people loves to take shortcut even when there is a road available they will say why not take this shortcut. My experience tells me the shortcut is very painful when you lead. Take a shortcut in law, take a shortcut in revenue matters and you know how people are suffering they are suffering for two reasons - The country has equality before law, rule of law is being in enforced in exemply manners those who thoughts we are beyond reach of law we are immune to law how can legal process reache they took shortcut you know how risky, how expensive, how painful shortcuts are, avoid them\\n\\nI urge all of you to be harbingers, ambassadors in\\xa0\\xa0kind of a society where you exemplify scrupulous, meticulous adherence to the rule of law. This should be your guiding North Star.\"),\n",

When you take shortcuts, when you violate the law, when you deviate from ethical standards, you can never have sound sleep. You will have sleepless nights, and your health will deteriorate. You are the greatest stakeholders in democracy; you are the future of this country. You have to lead the marathon march, and therefore, I appeal to you, make it a habit.You are all discerning minds; you will always stand for the nation, always put the nation first. We can never compromise on that. Unfortunately, there are certain categories of people who find it indigestible that India is progressing. Some of them are informed minds, You respect them. Don't respect them just because they have a position of power. I am referring to the economic world. One may be an economic advisor to the Government of India or a Governor of a Bank, but if they tell you our economic growth can't go beyond 5.5%, question them. You said so, why? You are a knowledgeable man; you are capitalizing on the ignorance of people at large; you are trying to spread pessimism when the air is full of optimism. Just imagine, no regret, we had more than 7.5% growth.You represent the core of progress and innovation. Your path aligns with Bharat's journey towards reaching new milestones! We must ever be good listener so that absorbing and sharing of knowledge is seamless. None is the ultimate repository of wisdom or knowledge. We suffered a system in our country where iconic was according not as parameter that are baffling no longer just look to the Padma awards there was a time when event management patronage was passage to Padma awards.They are now given longer than how you want to deserving people. the situation. You have to go beyond the normal cause if you entertain an Idea that this degree learning comes to an end trust me nothing can be more long conclusion to this learning is lifelong and if you learn lifelong you remain in feet health mental physical is spiritual to serve the nation. One thing I find and that is very disturbing people don't want to listen other points of you they want to reject others point of view for drop of a hat what can be more painful and challenge to logic and rationality that we don't want to consider other point of view there is no compulsory to agree on other's points of you and trust me my own experience tells more often the note the other points of view is the correct point of view. If you have attend the seminars you would have some illustrious person addressing the seminar but in interactive session you would find the one whom you don't look who according to you has no identity makes a brilliant point each of you is epicentre of making brilliant point and catalysing the big change. I am reminded of a cartoon where the boss was with his core team indicating “I am looking for people who have a mind of their own and always think my way”. Make your point know even if it is not accepted there will be a type when someone superior to you will tell you, how I wish I could go by your point of view. You turned out to be wrong,so always go in that\\xa0\\xa0direction. In your future positioning in normal course there would be compulsive interaction with business, trade, commerce and industry. You’ll have access to their structured platforms and associations. Avail the opportunity to serve the nation’s economy. My suggestion is that there can be significant positive contribution to our foreign exchange reserves, generation of employment opportunities and nurturing of entrepreneurship if we become ‘Vocal for Local’ and ‘Swadeshi’ is promoted. In a sense I am persuading you to believe and promote economic nationalism, a facet of nationalism. Just imagine there is a massive drain-out of our foreign exchange because we are important avoidably we are importing toys, curtains, furniture and furnishing. We are mostly important something that are available in this country a look at the damage that we do to fabric of this Nation.On one hand over foreign exchange is drain out on the other hand we are snatching work from the hand of our people they would employee if they were make to these item here and three we are blunting, impeding the growth of entrepreneurship now you are in well position to neutralise it if you make it a mission and passion to promote economic nationalism, inculcate this is spirit take us long way both the three points. There is another worrisome aspect is the reckless export of raw materials. Some people have natural resources at their disposal. If you go to a port in Goa you will know it iron ore is being exported now the man who controls the natural resource is making money, he says why should I make extra effort. I am making quick buck, I don't have to learn anything but but we are losing is hugely. We must add value to raw material and real time value before the export it. If we export raw material we are condemning ourselves that we are not in a position to add value to it. Fact is, we are in a position and the moment you engaged in value addition, you will find regarding results for both on the point of foreign exchange, employment and entrepreneurship growth. My young friends!Always remember no economic gain, how so bountiful it may be can be entertained by compromising our Economic Nationalism be must make it habit and national habit. This does result in easy and quick buck. Reflect at what cost to the nation. If there had been value addition to raw material within the country,\\xa0\\xa0the gain would be enormous in terms of saving foreign exchange and generating opportunities for employment and enterprise. This is imperative for our nation’s prosperity and sovereignty. Because if our security environment has to be looked at, the conventional days are going. If your economy is powerful, you are strong; your soft diplomacy gets cutting edge because your human resources are active in various fields. The human resources fully unleashing the power and prowess of digital infrastructure and disruptive technologies, and this is a national obligation you are called upon to discharge. Friends- today you are on the launchpad for a jump in the larger domain - overflowing with opportunities and challenges. There is potential even for run away success and unexpected jolt. You graduating students make discerning choice as to what you seek to do. Today you have the luxury of multiple options, of choosing what kind of work you will do and how you will do it. Go for the option/choice that emanates from within. For long we suffered in this country the child at birth was given a task “बच्चा घर मे आया है, इंजीनियर बनेगा, आईएएस बनेगा आईपीएस बनेगा डॉक्टर बनेगा”\\xa0, and the poor child did not know what is happening around fortunately for you the days have changed. If you do not enjoy the job you are doing, if you do not feel you are a productive, contributing member of society, rapid promotion or increasing renown is of no help because from within you can't relish it.If you do not like going to work every day, the fact that you are being chauffeured in a limousine is immaterial because it is not going to make it any more pleasant. Why force someone who is good at cricket to play chess you are train to make your own choices you are under no compulsion use it with great discretion. My suggestion to you is to reach out and explore. Try different things. Be unconventional. Think out of the box and assured you should ever be, you will never be out of ideas. There are ample avenues for creation of employment than just being an employee. People in bureaucracy are leaving their job to do unconventional things including selling vegetables, milk serving, serving the society showing way to many others. There is tendency in the youth, it was during my days is also. We will be happy if we achieve a lot - we want fame and fortune, and as rapidly as possible. In the process we get robotised. Our humane approach gets blunted, our human face disappears. A robot is\\xa0\\xa0of no use when a man becomes a robot man use a robot not himself or herself get robotized. Never fall prey to Shakespearian Hamlet syndrome of “To be, or not to be:” This stance more often than not is a recipe for failure. If you have a brilliant idea get it executed. Journey of your Chairperson Uday Kotak can be a case study on this point. He made such a choice, and from my perspective a difficult one in the early 1980. Then India was a closed economy and not a shade of economic growth and prosperity we see today almost around. In that challenging and daunting scenario, ignoring a lucrative job option from a Multinational, he decided to start out on his own. Look how he makes us all proud. While Uday Kotak at that time must have had tough time in deciding, with his heart beating in the chest. Yet he did. You all are fortunate as facilitating governance policies give you greater play in the joints for decision making. In conclusion, you are embarking on a most exciting journey. In a country that is home to one-sixth of humanity a country whose economy is on the rise. The world out there is fiercely competitive. There are bound to be challenges and air pockets. Be firm on your course. You should have no doubt about its success. You have been tampered by one of the most rigorous programs and obviously are now ready to show your mettle. Friends- I have full faith in the capabilities and potential as students of IIM Bodh Gaya, the enlightening IIM situated lightly at the centre of enlightenment you can deliver you only have to do. Remember one of the shoes company has tagline remember that “just do it”\\n\\nTogether, let us work towards a Bharat that is not just developed but also compassionate, and inclusive reflecting our civilisational ethos.

The subject is difficult, the subject is complex, in some sense, the subject is abstract. I have had the good fortune to go through some of the articles. I can see, without exception, that every contributor deserves applause for having engaged in his contribution with heart and soul in the article. And therefore a matter of joy and privilege to be with you all on this great occasion. The book title \"Law & Spirituality: Reconnecting the Bond.\" says it all. Bharat, home to 1/6 of humanity, is a spiritual centre of the world. This is the acknowledged reality. Our 5000 years civilizational ethos reveals it in every sense, and this was carried out to globe in more meaningful manner. In this contemporaneous time, by our G20 presidency, the world had the occasion to be exposed to the spirituality of this great Nation. When at about 60 locations G20 functions were held in every state and union territories of this country and the main function Bharat MandapamG20 main function and P20 at Yashobhoomi. It is time for us to reflect how we sustain our age-old legacy. This legacy is hard-earned through several mechanisms. I had the good fortune to find out the Hon’ble members from the parliament, as to how many of you have physically seen our Vedas, our Upanishads, our Puranas? We talk about them day in, day out, but have you really got into depth of it? I therefore made a suggestion to the Hon’ble ministers to make available to every parliamentarian Vedas. Trust me, having Vedas by your bedside will do a lot of good to humanity because the human beings that will test the Vedas will speak out of his soul, not out of his minor heart. When one speaks out of mind, they are dominated by rationality; when one speaks out of heart, they are dominated by emotive aspect also, but when there is a soul convergent, the things are very different. Friends, Bharat, with its civilization of 5000 years, has continually disseminated the message of \\'Dharma\\' and \\'Spiritualism\\' to the world through its timeless scriptures, philosophical treatises, and cultural practices. Law broadly indicates a regime that defines what people may do or not do. Adherence to the rule of law is the nectar of democracy. There have been regimes where adherents to the rule of law have been far more effective and possible in democracy, but the essence of democracy, the nectar of democracy, lies because the rule of law is deeply embedded with the concept of equality before law. A democracy has no meaning at all if there is no equality before the law. I have seen a transformative change in the last few years, which has strengthened the concept of equality before the law, ensuring all are subject to law, none are above the law, and none can claim immunity from the law. There was a time when some thought they were beyond the reach of the law. If, in a society, someone can get away by benefiting after engaging in transgression of the law, they are the sole beneficiary, but the entire society suffers. In democracy, we feel that jump of the heartbeat that explicitly questions, \"How come someone is more entitled than I am?\" That is equality before the law. That change we have seen. One direct outcome of equality before the law is that inequities are contained. No one will have grievances if all are treated equally. Grievances emanate when we engage in favouritism, when we believe in a mechanism that is antithetical to merit. That kind of mechanism is therefore fundamental to democratic rights, the flourishing of humanity, and I would say, survival of democracy. Friends, it is soothing to note that the privileged pedigree has been compulsively made accountable to the rule of law. We are seeing it, and there is bound to be resistance to it when people are used to be treated very differently, when they are assured by upbringing or otherwise that they have some kind of immunity from the law. And when they find the rule of law coming so close to them, making them accountable in a normal process, we must all remember fundamentally that when the law takes its course, it is the duty of society to ensure that we take recourse to legal remedies. Unfortunately, when the legal process is set in motion, I don\\'t understand why people should take to the streets because the fundamental of democracy is against the rule of law. Is it fair administration? And the fair administration emanates from a robust judicial system. We can be proud of our judiciary, how quickly it responds to citizen-centric issues. No country can claim to have the kind of robust judicial mechanism as we have in this country—fast, expeditious, and fairless. This big change that has come in the last few years has made our democracy more vibrant. It has become growth-oriented and recognized by the global order. This has generated an upbeat mood in the nation, and in our impressionable young minds, they are now filled with hope and possibility in an environment that is lawful. Spirituality is another facet which appears to be very abstract. If you scratch the surface, you will not be able to grapple with spirituality. I had the good fortune to attend a global spiritual conference. Spirituality reflects sublime concern for others and welfare of all. Spirituality guides us to discover that our lives are significant beyond ordinary existence, personal concerns and selfishness. Most of us are tied by these vices. We learn too late, after having negotiated precious time that we need to be in the other mode. spirituality will steer in us happiness for all, growth of all, concern of all. Friends, The combination of law and spirituality is thus a concept that can take us towards utopian governance, global peace and harmony. A combination of the two would unfold a legal regime and governance that would be non-invasive and wholesome for humanity. The effort by Professor Raman Mittal and Prof. Seema Singh in bringing out this book “Law and Spirituality: Reconnecting the Bond” is indeed commendable. The contributors have been drawn from various facets of human activity-\\xa0\\xa0from governance and constitutionalism; from law and justice; from spirituality and ethics; and the like. The book traverses critical aspects in relation to the theme “Law and Spirituality” covering the domain of justice, legal values, feminism and criminology. After having read parts of some of the articles, I can tell you it\\'s a treasure. you will be exposed to the erudition and expert knowledge of the author that has been well crafted in minimum words. The book deserves to be on the bedside of everyone as going through it would be an enriching experience and would lead to enlightenment of the individual, inspiring and motivating the reader to be in pursuit of service for humanity. I congratulate the editors, the contributors for this excellent effort and for effecting convergence of knowledge and talent of people from varied areas of human activity. Friends, I could have said more but after having gone through some of the articles and part of some of the articles, I advice everyone of you to keep the book by your bed side, make it a habit to go through it. Once you will go through it, trust me there will be seamless gliding through the entire book at 1 point of time or other and you will be benefited enormously. I am grateful to the audience for the time I have taken.'),\n",

Things have changed. Here I am, not the same man as I was then, and you are not the same as earlier. Change is the only constant. Distinguished member of the faculty, an institute has no meaning without devoted, committed, informed, erudite faculty. This one is gifted. I paid tribute to the father of the nation, I saw scripted there, Gandhiji reflected “Whenever you are in doubt, or when the self becomes too much with you, apply the following test. Recall the face of the poorest and the weakest man whom you may have seen, and ask yourself, if the step you contemplate is going to be of any use to him or her”\\nAnother talisman by Mahatma Gandhi ji “I care for your freedom because I valued mine.” Just imagine what he said! You are taking a leap into the nation that is on the rise, and your job will be as a public servant to sustain the incremental trajectory. I must particularly make reference to two officers of Bhutan Royal Services. They will carry our message of goodwill to the people of Bhutan, and this connection will be grateful for both sides. Keep this connection all your life. Bhutan is a lovely country. Congratulations to them.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text_of_the_VicePresident’s_address_at_v.txt', 'Ministry': 'Vice_Presidents_Secretariat', 'Month': 'April24html'}, page_content=\"There was a time when some other service held the primary position. It is just like if you go to Delhi, you go to various colleges of Delhi, and you go to one college and ask the very other college, they will say the college across the street. The college I am referring to is one in which Secretary General Rajya Sabha was a student in Saint Stephen College. When someone asks them where is Hindu College, they would not take the name; they would say the college across the road. This used to happen with services also, not any longer. Indian Revenue Service is unique; it has its own position. It is being rivalled by others. The Indian Revenue Service holds a pivotal role as the custodian of our taxation system. Because democracy is being driven by economic strength and you are integrally connected with that. As revenue officers, you are not merely tax administrators; you are entrusted with the stewardship of our fiscal framework, essential for the functioning of our democracy and the provision of public services. As public servants you are required to exemplify by conduct discipline, integrity, humility, ethics and sense of commitment. You are in a category of youth that is being watched and envied. You are natural role models, and you must be, therefore, inspirational and motivational to young minds all over the country. The world is changing at incredible speed. It is changing by seconds. Take your own domain, where you will be taking big steps. There has been transformational change in dynamics of tax administration and collection. We have moved from a predominantly traditional, paper-based system to a modern, technology-driven ecosystem where information is readily accessible and processes are streamlined for the benefit of both authorities and taxpayers. This transformation has revolutionised the way we administer taxes, making it more efficient, user-friendly, and transparent. Gone are the days when tax filing was a cumbersome and complex process, intimidating to the general public. People used to take leave from their service to be at the disposal of chartered accountants and work for several days, fearing that their tax return may not be accurate. Not any longer. The department has made such headway that all you need to file your return is available on your computer. Another aspect which you will relish, and for us, it is significant, is how amazingly friendly the system has become. Otherwise, a visit or a message from the tax inspector or officer would make you lose sleep, and you would worry about how to connect with them. But now, the system is friendly and hand-holding. It has been transformed from tax collection to tax facilitation. This change is significant and is altering the mindset of the nation's taxpayers. I am one of them, and I am amazed at how quickly returns are processed now. Taxpayers are mightily and surprisingly impressed with quick refunds and timely addressing of concerns\\nNow, transparency and accountability are new norms. The formal economy is fast replacing the informal structure of the economy. Embrace technology. People are realising that it is always gainful to be part of the formal economy than that of the informal economy. The formal economy gives you satisfaction and growth in a legally scripted manner, whereas the second one brings problems and travails. Taxpayers and citizens are increasingly demanding. They expect the tax administration to demonstrate fairness, equity, and transparency in all its facets and activities. Tax administrations are challenged to keep pace, answer the taxpayers' new needs and expectations while keeping tax fraud at bay. Dealing with tax fraud is a menace to society, a danger to the system. You have to deal with it with a heavy hand; your chairman indicated there has to be effective coupling of hand-holding reforms and demonstrating deterrents are equally necessary. There is a greater need to focus on concealing transactions and money. Some people still do not fall in order; they still think they can bypass your technological inputs, your intellect. They are mistaken; they will certainly be in your net. But better than getting them in the net is counselling them, disseminate information so that these elements are brought into the system. They must realise that the only good way to contribute to the nation is to follow the rule of law. People need to be made aware of the hazards of this. Technology is constantly watching them with Aadhaar, with PAN card, with transactions being necessarily reported, the department is fully aware of what is taking place. In the tax fraud category, you can't outsmart the system. Sooner or later, you will be in the net. This counselling is sufficient for them. Tax fraud is a challenge to social order. He gets ill-gotten wealth that is not accountable to the department. Take steps vigilantly, use technology, and you will find an easy answer for it. The introduction of online portals, digital platforms, and automated systems has simplified tax compliance, making it easier and more convenient for individuals and businesses to fulfil their obligations, and enhancing the ease of doing business in the country. The increasing digitalization of tax administration in India is truly laudable. As a matter of fact, global entities including the World Bank have appreciated our digital penetration. Our transactions are digital; they have contributed massively to the formal economy evolution. The Faceless E-Assessment system has already brought about a paradigm shift from territorial jurisdiction to dynamic jurisdiction. It has introduced anonymity in income tax assessment and appeals to ensure transparency and accountability, and is living up to its objective of ‘honouring the honest’\\nFriends, we are living in a time that is tough. New technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and advanced analytics are improving tax governance and helping curb tax evasion. Most importantly, this enhances the trust of the taxpayer in the system, which in turn encourages greater compliance. As young professionals, you will have to grapple with disruptive technology. You will have to embrace them beyond your curriculum. Take, for example, blockchain and machine learning. These two technologies will always be available to discharge your obligations to your work and to the nation outstandingly. Blockchain technology is an advanced database mechanism that allows transparent information sharing within a business network. A blockchain database stores data in blocks that are linked together in a chain. As future custodians of this evolving tax regime, I urge each one of you to embrace technology as an enabler of positive change. Technology also discourages the informal handling of cash, which is extremely damaging to society. Steps like these have brought about unprecedented transparency and accountability within the system, aligning with the new norm of zero-tolerance to corruption in Bharat today. Power corridors have been duly neutralised of corrupt elements. Corruption is no longer a password to opportunities and contracts; corruption is a passage to a place that is a jail. Constant and continuous skill upgrading and exposure to newer facets of taxation such as international taxation and implications of tax treatise will also be crucial for the future. Your role in ensuring effective tax administration & in creating deterrence against tax evasion make you critical contributors to the act of nation-building. I gathered it from newspaper report that you have initiated mechanism today to reach out to those and the number is more than 15 million or so who were required to file tax return have not filed it this is the major challenge. I would urge every citizen of this country to take note of it. We do have large number of taxpayer 8 crores or above but we are nation of 1.4 billion the number has to go up. In taking recourse to non invasive mechanism persuasion, counseling, hand holding but ensuring at end of day each of them files return. Make them feel proud that by filing return by paying your tax you are becoming participant in growth of nation that is on the rise and the rise is unstoppable. India has more Promise than any large country in this world. India is no longer a country with potential or sleeping giant. India is very much fast moving towards becoming a global superpower\\nWe are now a land of Hope and Possibility, a favourite global destination of investment and opportunity, Bharat is preparing itself as a future global superpower. There are skeptics outside and inside, those skeptics are trying to occupy public space my message to them, the skeptics of our exponential development and unstoppable rise need to step out of “bubble” to experience the environment of Hope and Possibility. This is a different Bharat, the fastest growing major economy in the world. We are defining global discourse in several ways. India gave yoga to the world; on 21st June, it is celebrated all over the world. Our visionary Prime Minister took the initiative in the United Nations, and in the shortest time, the largest number of countries came forward to support it. India is the headquarters of the International Solar Alliance. Look at our landscape; it is dotted by solar power, biofuels, millet, the voice of the global south, and the like. If you go further, you will find our soft diplomatic power has a cutting edge. Now, during the G20 presidency, India became the voice of the global south. Look at the kind of GDP they represent, the population they represent, and there was not being heard. It is now on a prominent platform, thanks to Bharat, our visionary leadership. At one time after independence, India was among the poorest countries in the world. For our survival in the 60s, we used to wait for aid from outside, particularly from the USA. When I was elected to parliament in 1989 and had the good fortune to be in the ministry in that government, I tell you, what was the size of our economy in 1991, you will be surprised. Our economy, that was known as “Sone ki Chidiya” at one time, was less than the economy of Paris and London, two cities separately, that were our size. And now, we are ahead of the UK, Canada, and France. In the next 2 years, we will be ahead of Japan and Germany. India is the fastest growing major economy in the world, with an average GDP growth rate of 6.5% to 7%. Friends, the path towards Viksit Bharat@2047will be charted by young minds like you. Your dedication, integrity, and commitment to excellence will play a pivotal role in shaping the economic landscape of our country for years to come. You must instill in people a sense that the surest passage to success is to be tax compliant and law abiding. In everyday life, if you take shortcuts, this will turn out to be the longest, painful route. When you are in need of shortcuts, unbearable pain will be inflicted on you if you take shortcuts with the law, with legal regime, with tax regime. Potential taxpayers need to be informed about the advantages of being part of the formal economy, and the travails of not being so. In the pursuit of India's growth story, I call upon you to work tirelessly. You can't afford to spare even a second because our country, unlike others, has a civilization of more than 5000 years. We are cut out to be a global leader in Amrit kaal. We have set for my foundation aur Bharat to be a developed nation in 2047. People like you, young people in your category, they constitute the core strength of this marathon march of viksit Bharat@2047. I call upon you to work towards achieving our collective aspirations. Empower taxpayers with information, foster trust through transparency, and uphold the highest standards of integrity in your professional conduct. There comes a time in everybody's life when we seek to deviate from sublimity, spirituality, ethical standards, or integrity. Don't yield to that weak moment, because that yielded moment will always resonate in your ear. If you succumb to the temptation, which is more momentary, which is not lasting, don't become a victim of that. Your career has to blossom for you, your family, your friends, and the nation. Each of you is a catalyst for change, with the potential to take the benefits of economic progress to every corner of our diverse society. I once again congratulate the graduating officers on this memorable milestone. Embrace the challenges that lie ahead with enthusiasm and a spirit of service to humanity. You are much beyond just being members of Indian Revenue Service. By virtue of the service you are in, you are in the premium category of the society. Exploit this position for the national welfare. I appeal to you, being vocal for local. Now, you as text administrators will know, avoidable imports are a heavy drain on our foreign exchange, to the extent of billions. They deprive works from our youngsters, handicapping their evolution to entrepreneurship. You will be interfacing with the business people. You can enlighten them, you can imbibe in them the spirit of nationalism, what is available in the country, why we should import that, tell them the ill effects of that, merely because it can benefit someone financially to import furniture from outside, curtains from outside, candles, kites, children's toys. Once you do it, you will be bringing about affirmative change in three aspects:\\n1. foreign exchange will not be drained out. 2. Employment will be generated\\n3. Entrepreneurship will take a big jump. Similarly, friends, impress on people, it is not a good idea, surely not good economics, thoroughly not good national spirit to export raw material. We are capable of adding value. The world is coming to us, but merely because someone is sitting over a reservoir, let's say a natural resource, why should I bother, let me export it as it is, I get money. You can do it, keep that in mind. I congratulate the National Academy of Direct Taxes for doing fine work of training young officers like you. A great job! Congratulations to them! I congratulate the Income Tax Department and able leadership for keeping pace, and sometimes being ahead of it, the national parameter of development. The department that people thought will never ever be friendly to people, they will never engage in hand holding, is in the front league of hand holding at the moment, transparent and accountable. Congratulations to the department. Friends, as you embark on this new chapter of your career, may you find fulfilment and purpose in serving our beloved Bharat. Thank you so much. Jai Hind! *****\\nMS/JK/RC\\n\"),\n",

A man with rich experience of having been a parliamentarian for two terms and now holding this constitutional position. This constitutional position of the Governor is no longer ornamental and we have the right man at the right place with right experience, right dedication and right commitment. Padma Awards have got very high credibility.They are no longer driven by patronage or so-called iconic status or reputations built by event management. Padma Awards are very authentic and you all must have been surprised that when a person next door gets Padma Award you never look for that. But your reaction will be the right person has got it. In this case the right persons have got it. So I was there. We interacted with the couple a little more extensively when we invited them and others who had got Honoris Causa from Punjab University for lunch. Very simple, very modest, not driven by commerce, not driven by the balance sheet results. The balance sheet must respect and reveal societal aspect. But thanks to pandemic COVID and pandemic COVID has taught us many good lessons. One is the world has come to know about you people more closely. You have been majorly instrumental in taking care of 1.3 billion people, making us proud all the way. But what is more significant of their contribution is that this country, while handling its own problem, handheld 100 other countries, Covaxin Maitri. We gave COVID vaccine free to about 100 countries. Now I come to the real point. How this has been brought about? Research, development, innovation. Research and development are the final strength of any economy. They are the final strength of any nation. Execution is never a problem. Execution can take place by mediocrity, but developing a particular medicine, being innovative about it, that's the greatest help you can contribute to the humanity at large. This company stands out.\"),\n",

It stands out because of the people before me also. And those who are in attendance in virtual mode. And those who may have served here and may have retired. Because it is the human capital that is precious. It is the human capital that alone is the ultimate repository of your wealth. I have come across many educational institutions. People who are big in infra, never had academic inclinations, have excellent institutions. But faculty is missing. That's the situation. Your esteemed institution has truly set a benchmark in innovation, research, service, and education. You are not driven by commerce interest. Of course, every mechanism has to be sustainable. If it is not sustainable, it wouldn't work. Then this company has been a pioneer. And a pioneer is one who faces headwind more severely than others. Headwind in the shape of administrative hiccups. Headwind in the shape of assimilating human resource. Headwind initially in the shape of there not being sustainable financial reward. But this has become a success model. I am told 9 billion vaccine doses globally have been delivered. Of course, our countries are big in size. And we know big numbers. 1.4 billion. 9 billion is quite a statistical figure. Staggering. Then it gives emphasis to alleviation of human misery. Because it has been said over ages, If you are not healthy, you cannot deliver. You may be talented. You may be committed. You may be possessed of highest integrity and ethical standards. You may have a brain which is remarkable. But if health fails you, rather than being asset to society, you become a liability. And if a person is not possessed of these great study qualities and suffers health hazard, his economy is already vulnerable. It is nothing short of a panic in the entire family. Therefore, this work is remarkable human service. Because we are living in times where we have become too materialistic. We talk of mind. Occasionally we talk of heart. But rarely we talk of soul. Now soul and spirituality define a human being. And that comes only when society is not overtaken by health hazards. Fortunately, a country of our size has seen in recent years, policy initiatives and schemes that have hand-held the last in the row. I am talking about the health program we have in the country. I think its reach is beyond any program in the world. But then a lot more is to be done. If you look at our ancient scriptures, our Vedas, Atruvaveda in particular, you will find that focus on health and the kind of situations they have indicated. Now companies like this can work in innovation, research, development, to bring about a mechanism of prevention, precaution. Let us not get alert when we have a mechanism where the button has to be pressed and the doctor has to be summoned. That situation must be avoided.\"),\n",

I am sure a company like this would for sure take care of dissemination of right information, right knowledge across all segments of society, rural, tier 2 cities, tier 3 cities, and urban centres. Your exceptional contribution made us proud for another reason. And that is India's unprecedented technological penetration, digital penetration. A decade ago, imagine what the scene was. And the scene was we were counted as a nation, fragile five, facing difficult situations, traversing difficult terrain. We have negotiated to slot number five, ahead of Canada, ahead of UK, ahead of France. Matter of time, we'll be ahead of Japan and Germany. But France and most of you will not be aware. When I was elected to Parliament in 1989, and it was a good fortune to be a minister, the size of the Indian economy, hold your breath, make sure of your seats, was less than that of cities like Paris and London. Can you imagine? In 1991, right now our foreign exchange reserves are more than 600 billion. In 1991, to sustain our fiscal credibility, we had to physically load our gold in a plane. To be placed to two sea banks. What I'm telling you is we have come a long way. We are at a place which I never imagined in 1991. Never dreamt of, never thought our Bharat will be what it is today. There is not a sector in which we are not in the big league. Let's talk of space. Chandrayaan 3 landed at that part of the moon where no one has landed. On 23rd August, 2023, it has become now a space day. Tiranga and Shiva Shakti points are embedded on the surface of the moon. Thanks to our achievements. All this because ISRO, an organisation like you, is engaged in that activity. Go to 60s, rocket parts being taken on a bicycle. In 60s, our neighbouring country could put its satellite in the space from the homeland. We couldn't. And now this country puts in space satellites of developed nations. Singapore to UK and others. And why? Good value for money. But look at our national temperament, some of them. They continue to be in the bubble. They are incorrigible critics of our development. They are recipe for chaos. Chandrayaan 2, it was September 2019. Along with my wife, I went to science city in Kolkata as governor of state of West Bengal. 500 boys and girls were with me. Around 2 a.m. or thereabout, the landing was not soft. We reached quite close to the surface. Very close to it, just few centimetres. Landing was not smooth. Some people took it as failure. It wasn't failure. It was success but not 100%. If Chandrayaan 3 is a success story, the foundation was laid by Chandrayaan 2. And therefore, when you are engaged in such a difficult task, there will be failures. There will be fear of failure also. There will be people to compete and walk away with success which may be yours. Notwithstanding that, our pursuit to serve humanity by research and development, scientific research should never get impeded. Indigenous research is something on which you must focus. There was a time when we would wait leisurely that a product will be developed in the West. Let's take a radio. We'll get it after about 5-6 years. Then we got it after about 2 years. Then we got about 6 months. And now we get it immediately. But now, there is reversal. Our products are going outside. We got into that mode. Now, I put two poses before you. 100 billion or more foreign exchange is being drained out every year because we import items that are available. This is, as a matter of fact, disrespect to being vocal about local or commitment to society. I term it as economic nationalism. It immediately has three serious dangerous consequences. One, avoidable drain of foreign exchange. Secondly, when we import avoidable imports, items that are made available here, only for some fiscal gain. We are depriving our people of employment. We are snatching work from their hands. And more critically, we are also impeding entrepreneurship growth. Same is about raw material export. Why should a nation of our size export raw material? Why should we declare to the whole world that we can't add value to it? We export raw material. Value is added, we import the item to which value has been added to our raw material by someone outside. Now, while your stream may be different, you are a leader in research and development. You are trailblazers. This must be there in all areas. I am an agriculturalist. I belong to a farmer's family. I know the importance of education. But for admission to any school, I may not have got opportunity. There was no road, no electricity, no water, no toilet in the house. What I see in every village now. Transformative change. Toilet is there. Tap water is there. Electricity is there. The Internet is there. And education is also there. The world is stunned that the per capita internet consumption of this great nation of 1.4 billion per capita is more than that of USA and China taken together. Our digital transactions are nearly 50% of global transactions, empirically. It could be one or two percent, less or more. In such a situation, how painful it is. Because I am before people who have discerning minds, scientific temper, who have capacity to change Bharat and the world, not arithmetically, but geometrically. Can we countenance anti-national narratives? Can we suffer an expert trying to capitalise on ignorance of others? He knows full well what I am saying is wrong. He knows India's economy will be rising more than 7.5%, which it did at the relevant time. He said it wouldn't go more than 5%. By virtue of the position he held, ordinary people believed him. Those who are doubting our accomplishments have to experience it by cutting out of that bubble. Commitment to nationalism is not optional. It's the only way out. We have to be proud Indians. We have to take pride in our historical accomplishments. I don't want to tell you what we have achieved. But just look at the last few months. New building of parliament in less than 30 months. Not just a building. Made functional inside, 100%. We had Bharat Mandapam, one of the ten global convention centres. Where we held G20. Yashod Bhoomi, where we held P20. Look at our train mechanism. Look at our airports and railway stations. Look at our highways. Look at our digital penetration. Now, all this has to sustain. By we Indians being different. We can no longer afford to look for technology outside. I am happy to share with you. That when it comes to disruptive technologies, you are aware of them. You are informed scientific minds. It is nothing less than a new industrial revolution. These technologies have entered our homes, our offices, our way of life. Artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, blockchain, machine learning and the kind. Now research has to generalise them. These technologies otherwise are like unregulated nuclear explosion. But if nuclear power is regulated, you get power. That is another challenge. So one Bharat by take is not enough. Hundreds are not enough. In a country of our size, the number has to multiply. And seriously, India is known as the pharmacy of the world. Just imagine. The most populous country in the world. This pharmacy of the world means it has taken care of its own populace. And then catering to others also. There is more to be done. Our radar has to focus on global issues. The world is finding it very difficult to deal with challenges which I call existential. They are challenges not for one country. Not for one region. Not for one kind of human race. These are challenges for the entire planet. Disease, health, food, climate change. And the solution lies only in research and development and technology. Friends, all over the world, academics have blossomed. On account of corporates hand-holding them. If you look at institutions of repute in the western world, they have become financial giants because their alumni have contributed. Industry has supported the research. How painful it is. And some of us within the country have doled out millions of dollars to those institutions, ignoring institutions at home. I'm not criticising. They may have done it rationally, thoughtfully, for a valid cause. But I appeal from this platform. Our corporates, they must hand-hold research and development. They must hand-hold our academic institutions. I was at a function recently where I put a point across. For consideration, I'll do it here. CSR fund is defined by statute. For some companies, the amount will be such that even if there is a will, intent, nothing can be achieved. But if corporates come on the same platform, that every year we will use part of CSR to bring one or two great research centres, institutes of excellence, they have funds from CSR. If they part with part of the CSR fund, in a structured manner, it will do wonders. And in a decreased time, our country will be having institutions all over of that category. I think that is something we should be seriously focusing. Another thing which the team here can take note of and act is we have greatest talent pool reserve in the shape of alumni of institutions, IITs, IIMs, great colleges, other institutions engaged in science, technology, forensic science. They are alumni. The alumni are all over. The alumni come together, engage in an activity to help their institute in infrastructure or otherwise. But if they constitute a think tank for policy formation of this country, I can assure you it will do wonders, including in your own line. They both have seen both the words. They were there. And came in late 90s here. Future belongs to Bharat. Our present is proof of it. At present, we are the only country of our size where the economy is growing faster than anyone else. We are the only country indicated by World Bank, IMF, World Economic Forum as a favourite destination of investment and opportunities. Presently, we are the only country whose human resource is contributing all over the globe in apex institutions. We are the only country of our size that has vibrant democracy, constitutionally structured at all levels from village to the centre. And therefore, to say that we are emerging now as a superpower, we are no longer a country with potential. We are no longer a sleeping giant. We are fast moving.\"),\n",

Greetings to you all. I am indeed overwhelmed by being with you all in this sublime proceedings. I landed in Tirupati, had darshan at the temple. Friends, it is the Tirupati one that comes closest to divinity, spirituality, and sublimity. I experienced this at the Darshan. I felt blessed and sought bliss for all. I am honoured to be here at this 3rd Convocation. Your Motto, 'Tamaso ma Jyotirgamaya', lead me into life from darkness. This is motivational, inspirational. It is in sync with civilization. It captures the essence of life. You have to live up to this Motto. पिछले 4 दशकों में, तिरुमला पर्वत के तल पर स्थित राष्ट्रीय संस्कृत विद्यापीठ संस्कृत भाषा और विशेष कर पारंपरिक शास्त्रों के अध्ययन और अध्यापन का विशिष्ट केंद्र रहा है। This place is unique for this particular domain. मेरा ज्यादातर लगाव न्याय क्षेत्र से रहा है। अब मेरा लगाव संसद से रहा है। जब मैं दोनों की तरफ देखता हूं, तब इस विश्वविद्यालय की याद आना स्वाभाविक है।\\nविद्यापीठ के अध्यक्षों में कौन-कौन है? भारतीय पूर्व मुख्य न्यायाधीश पतंजलि शास्त्री, प्रसिद्ध V Raghavan और लोकसभा के पूर्व अध्यक्ष श्री एम.ए. अय्यंगार, और आज वर्तमान में विश्वविद्यालय को अनुभवी और योग्य पद्म भूषण श्री एम गोपाल स्वामी का मार्गदर्शन प्राप्त हो रहा है।\\nI extend my congratulations to all the graduating students. You have received your degree today; this is a significant day in your life. This is a cornerstone measure, a milestone for you, your parents, your friends, your teachers.

Your parents have the greatest satisfaction when you get into the IAS by seeing the reaction of the neighbors, and suddenly you will find an upsurge in their morale. Never forget what you are because of them. It is because of their sacrifice. It is indeed gratifying to address young minds, and after this rigorous training, you are impregnably mature. You have made it to this place, you know it. It was the most difficult tunnel to cross. You never so lightly attend to the road till you see your name in the list. As I focus here on bright minds and promising leaders, I don\\'t mean only political leaders. Though we are having increasingly trained bureaucrats in service and out of service getting into politics, and they make it to mighty positions also. I am reminded of the rich legacy of this esteemed institution, where countless civil servants have been nurtured and groomed to serve our great nation and all of them contributed to its emergence of Bharat at this stage. Each one of you, my friends, embodies excellence, integrity, and commitment to public service, qualities that are indispensable for shaping the destiny of our nation. I see in you the potential to define Bharat in your vision and conception, and trust me, you are competent on our March to 2047, viksit Bharat. At that point of time, all of you will be in commanding positions, and I and many like me will be watching from heaven, the glorious moment. Bharat is on the rise as never before, and there is well-placed confidence that you all will sustain and contribute to further galloping of this exponential developmental journey. Me and my generation have seen Bharat where there was no light in the village and no road connectivity. You can\\'t think of tap water; you can\\'t think of a toilet in the house. You can never imagine a gas connection in the house; you can\\'t have a school in your village or at the most to be satisfied to have a primary school, and look at where we are. Let me advert to the various facets of contemporaneous national scenarios- pertaining to economic, political, social and geopolitical facets. On economic fundamentals,\\xa0the last decade has been marked with a sea change that makes present times one of hope and possibility. Overcoming a difficult phase there is transition from an environment of despondency and to one of upbeat mood. You have to capitalise on it, monetize for National welfare. Our economy over this period withstanding head winds and negotiating difficult terrain has traversed from being fragile five global economies to being the fifth largest global economy ahead of our colonial masters, the United Kingdom, Canada and France. In about two years or so Bharat, home to one-sixth of humanity, would be the third largest global economy ahead of Japan and Germany. When I got into parliament in 1989, I had occasion to be Union Minister. I suffered the pain Bharat that was known as ‘Sone Ki Chidiya’, the gold, in physical terms, had to be lifted to be placed into two Swiss banks to sustain our fiscal credibility. What I see today, I never imagined. That\\'s a big change. My young friends, we are already the third largest global purchasing power. Our Marathon March from Amrit Kaal to Vikasit Bharat@ 2047 is well scripted by visionary thought of our Prime Minister, who is committed to cause in mission mode with deep passion, and this is coupled with dedicated execution of your fraternity, the two are complementary. You have to translate into success visionary policies, and that Indian bureaucracy is doing day in and day out at the moment. Our economy has been spinally strengthened by transformative policies and innovative reforms resulting in ease of living for those in the last row as mentioned by Mahatma Gandhi ji in his concept of antyodaya. This very thoughtful concept of Mahatma Gandhi ji, the antyodaya taking care of the man last in the row, is being realised. Work is in progress by and large, it is ground reality. The world\\'s largest tax reform - goods and services tax-the GST was unfolded at the Central Hall of Parliament in 2017 by the then Hon’ble President Pranab Mukherjee and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. My young friends, in the same Central Hall, on the midnight of 14th - 15th August 1947, India on attainment of independence had “Tryst with Destiny” and on midnight of 30th June - 1st July 2017, the nation with initiation of the GST regime had “Tryst with Modernity”. GST has been a game changer reform and has added to the growth of the economy making it more transparent and enabling for its contributors. Contrary to the global scenario, our economy has been steadily looking up despite challenges of the Covid Pandemic and global conflagrations threatening supply chains. It must be soothing to all of you that hardly a week passes when our Navy has performed to save the supply chains, to rescue victims of piracy. Every Indian would be proud of their accomplishment. Nation witnessed not pyramidical but plateau kind of societal development. For the needy and suffering upliftment has been transformative beyond contemplation. In a country of our size and diversity, it was indeed a staggering thought that every household will have electricity, difficult to think, look at the staggering thought that occurred in the mind of our visionary leadership of the Prime minister. He thought every household will have electricity, toilets, tap water, and gas connection and every person would have access to health and education facilities. A good wish list, a great dream but what has happened. These are now largely ground reality and the work is in progress. You will have to sustain it. Friends, unimaginable milestones, high digital and technological connectivity across the country have been no less than stunning accomplishments. There was a time when we were decades behind the Global technological moment. Look at where we are, turning out to be leaders. This has resulted in India accounting 50% of global digital transactions in the year 2023. We are ⅙ of humanity but our share of global distal transactions is 50%, something that we make our head high. We will ever take pride in this accomplishment. Digital connectivity with robust infrastructure has enormously benefited the country because now it is available in every nook and corner of the country. It dots our geographical area. Every village has it. You no longer suffer the pain if you are from the village, you will get the same facility. Internet accessibility and adaptability in every part of the country is evidenced by the fact that our per capita internet consumption happens to be more than that of the USA and China taken together. This game-changer technological penetration has also massively contributed to governance accountability and transparency. My young friend- recall a prime minister of this country in the 1980s lamented that not even 15% of the amount meant for the development reaches the beneficiary. It was his concern that 85% goes elsewhere. And now, what a 360 degree change now as the intended beneficiary receives digitally 100% assistance without leakage, intermediary or middleman. They receive it in their bank. What a visionary step was taken to include 500 million people in the banking system. They opened their Account for the first time. Look at the gain we are getting thereof. Let me come to my grassroot. I am the son of a farmer. I am from a village. I am the first generation to step out. What I say today and what I could not imagine when I was a Minister and member of parliament 30 years ago is that now about 100 million farmers receive three times a year direct transfer in their bank, PM kisan Nidhi Samman. The government may be prepared, the robust infrastructure may be prepared but the glorious accomplishment is that the farmer is prepared to receive it and is receiving it and this amount at the moment my young friend is about 3 lac crore, not a small amount. Service delivery for the ordinary person has been technologically driven given the facility in nearly all the villages with computer centres. Look at young people in the villages, tier 2 cities when they apply for a job, when they fill examination form, when they seek a passport, they no longer have to use the old method that was having a drain on finance and hours. They do it by technological means. New Education Policy after a gap of over three decades is poised to bring about much needed revolutionary change in the education system. It is now tailored to suit our needs, our thinking, our dreams. We don\\'t dream in a foreign language, we dream in our own language and the shift is from a mere degree of orientation to skill evolution and the shift is timely. Our rail, road and air connectivity which you see day in a day out ask your grandparents, your parents what was the situation then and what is the situation now, not only quantitative but qualitative also. We are having a world class railway station airport and look at our road and look at multiple choices for connectivity to a particular place. Let me go to my home State Jaipur. Delhi-Jaipur there is only one road through Alwar, \\xa0over a period of time it came direct to Kotputli and now it is part of the Delhi Bombay Grand Highway world class Highway. There was a time earlier it used to be 98 hour now it takes 5-6 hour that is a big change\\nOur infrastructure has shown quantum jump quantitatively and qualitatively and matches global best. On the international front G-20 was a resounding success. Every state and union territory organised G20 functions. The world witnessed Bharat civilizational ethos of more than 5000 years old. They were exposed to our culture, they were exposed to the sharpened intellect of our human resource, they were exposed to the level of reception we people have in this country and the final was held at Bharat Mandapam, one of the top 10 convention centers of the world. The prime minister has the privilege to receive world leader and look at the background, you must have seen it on and when the only the walk through the alley, they exposed to our Civilization wealth of 5000 years and then we had P-20 held at YashoBhoomi, another convention centre with parking place of more than 3000 cards. I was at both the places. I could not believe my eyes but what was surprising and soothing that Global leaders were applauding. That is what it is. Our growth is not just in infrastructure. G20 will be historically known that Bharat is emerging as a world leader sharpening its soft diplomatic power. The African Union has been included in G20. We became the voice of the global. Governance that would largely be your concern has taken a turn for the better. Equality before law that had eluded us for long and corruption that was running into the veins of administration like blood are now matters of the past. My young friends, you and your colleagues in civil services have contributed to this revolution silently. You will have the occasion to contribute passively. It will be mostly in silence but trust me when accomplishment is effected in silence it resonates in the ears of the common man and one and all. Privileged pedigree, for long beyond the rule of law, was reaping the harvest while meritocracy suffered, is now sulking in the bye lanes. Democratic values and essence is deepening as equality before law is being enforced in an exemplary manner and corruption is no longer a trading commodity. Earlier it was the only mechanism to contract, recruitment,\\xa0opportunity. Nothing would happen unless you take this route. Those who took this route facilitated the root by being corrupt, having made to take route of law. Our power corridors have been sanitised of corruption. Those who extra legally leveraged decision making in seats of power are now on the run and in tight grip of law. Transparency and accountability, ease of governance define governance. I was exposed when I headed a group of 10 governors on Ease of doing business. I was therefore came to be educated, I would say. What was the situation earlier and what is the situation now? The change could not have been far more effective that it is today. The cumulative impact of all these changes has been that the country has been pulled out of despondency. India has become land of hope and possibility, hotspot of global opportunity, favourite destination for investment. This is where you are at the moment. You have to catalyse on this situation. We were living at times at your age when we used to satisfy ourself that India has potential, India is the sleeping having but why young friends you are fortunate. I would say in a country of 1.4 billion people you are fortunate that your number here is within three digits and you can take pride now India is no longer a nation with potential. We are no longer a sleeping giant. We are on the move. You have to accelerate this moment. The global establishments are in punishing mode for our neighbours but what do they say about us now. The World Bank, the IMF, and forums like the World Economic Forum, have acclaimed from the public domain our phenomenal rise as a model for the rest of the world in the field of digitization and several other areas. The nation suffers some problems and you have to live with it. We were in a state of hopelessness. Article 370, the only temporary article of the constitution, was presumed to be the only final article of the constitution. People advocated after taking oath of the Constitution that article 370 is beyond change. You know historically Dr. Ambedkar, Chairman of the Drafting Committee drafted all the articles of the Constitution except the article 370. Peep into history you will find out what he declined to do. His communication on this point is very emotive and that emotion was taken care of. During this decade article 370 is no longer in the constitution. A big change we never imagined. What I am indicating to us is that you will have to contribute more because some of the greatest obstacles that pained us have been overcome and look that what has happened after article 370 ceased to be in the constitution, Jammu and Kashmir is blossoming. Can you imagine unfurling the flag was a difficult situation and now G20 functions are held there. World leaders were there. The economy is looking up. Members of your tribe who had the occasion to have that as your cadre state had the occasion to serve it for decades but denied even a piece of land for your residence. To put it from your perspective, a big change has taken place. Hope has been rekindled in Jammu and Kashmir resulting in a huge positive upsurge in the economy and development of the area. It is back as a favourite tourist destination with lacs going there now year by year. Women reservation that eluded us for about three decades. I would not decry anyone, earnest efforts were made to see that they become part of policy making. They become part of the legislature, they become part of law making, earnest efforts were made that did not succeed. Fortunately they succeeded. Last year women representation in Lok Sabha will be more than one third because one third is reserved. It will be more than one third in the State Legislature and this reservation comes with societal angles also. Scheduled Caste,\\xa0Scheduled Tribe will get reservation within the reservation. So the reservation has a societal angle by being both horizontal and vertical. I have no doubt and not because I have only a daughter. Women will contribute more effectively, impactfully, soothingly the human face of policy by the training the live they lead the challenges they face they are well equipped to give that input but they can give it only when they are in the room where decisions are being taken and they will have this occasion now\\nMy young friends I have in a macro manner adverted to these aspects only to indicate that at your launchpad time you have an enabling echo system that will help you expand your talent and dedication optimally for the nation. You can effect the change you believe in. This is a rare opportunity. People believe in a change but handicapped in bringing the change. You are in the position to bring change. However there are some worrisomely alarming challenges we face from within and without. There is strategize orchestration of factually untenable anti national narratives aimed at tainting and tarnishing our glorified and robust constitutional bodies. Decrying our growth journey. I don\\'t think we need lessons from everyone anyone about rule of law about a robust judicial system about methods elevate poverty. How can anyone lecture in the world to our nation that from April 1 2020 is making available free food to 850 million people. This does not indicate poverty. This is a helping hand to them that yes they must keep on coming up and rising to higher level. We can\\'t allow others to calibrate us because they neither have the resources nor knowledge or understanding of how this country works with 5000 year old ethos where we treat and that treatment is reflected in our G20 Motto “one earth, one family, one future”. When I was talking about anti national narratives. You are well informed minds. Just imagine the Citizen Amendment Act. Now anyone who can spell a moment with modest intellect to go through that Amendment Act would know it does not deprive anyone of his or her citizenship, it does not handicap anyone on the globe to apply for Indian citizenship. The system is there. What does it do? It facilitates acquisition of Indian citizenship for Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from the neighbouring countries of Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who arrived in India on or before 31 December 2014. It is not an invitation for influx and why it is being conferred on them. They have been prosecuted on the account of their religious belief. Our nation has been home to such people for thousands of years. Jews Parsi zoroastrians they found centuries growth whole some situation here and this some call discriminatory. We have to neutralize these narratives. These emanate not out of ignorance; these emanate out of a strategy to run down our nation. This Nation on the planet does not need any script or Sermon from anyone on the point of equality. We believe in it. Let them look back, some countries have a woman president. We had a woman Prime Minister because the UK had. We have a Supreme Court. In other countries the Supreme Court has completed two centuries or more without a woman judge. We welcome all lectures and all sources of knowledge if they emanate from bonafide intentions. Friends, the freedom and democracy that we take for granted today is an outcome of unimaginable sacrifices by many valian unsung Heroes of our freedom movement. Fortunately we are giving due to our heroes, though belatedly. For too long a period, our freedom movement warriors left to be recognized. But now we have Parakram Divas for Netaji Subhash Bose and his statue is there at India gate, we have Jan Jaatiya Gaurav Divas dedicated to Birsa Munda\\nRecent conferment of Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian award posthumously to Karpoori Thakur, Chaudhary Charan a symbol of transparency accountability integrity and firm believer in growth of village, PV Narsimha Rao, a political statesman, and Dr M S Swaminathan has been widely acclaimed. This honour should have come to these noble souls long ago. My young friends- You are discerning minds. You will impact this society more than anyone else. People will look up to you as role models. It is a gratifying moment for them when they meet you. The way you behave in society is taken to be worth emulation. You are inspiration and motivation for the area in which you are great and therefore corresponding obligation that you have to exemplify your conduct accordingly. You will have to seek admiration of the elders and you will have to be motivational for the younger mind. Work with Seva Bhav and Sahanubhuti a sense of service and empathy deeply embedded in our Civilizational ethos to be your guiding principle. Adhere to it. it will change society and you have the capacity to catalyse this change. My young friends, your potential is undoubted, your ability is established, your opportunity is well recognised and in such a situation you have to take care of certain things which are deficiency in a society like public discipline to name just one. You can transform it. The greatest challenge to our democratic polity is emanating from those who have long been part of dispensation, have held positions of authority, had the occasion to contribute to the development of the nation and once out of authority they become a complete recipe for chaos. They would say India is sinking, its economy cannot go beyond this level. You know who I am referring to. We have to challenge these as was indicated by one of the speakers here. We can\\'t take it as firm and final. The repetition they built was on the opportunity they got in governance. They are fritting and fritting away because they tend to do things from a political prism. We have to address nationalism and look at the prism that promotes nationalism. These people have poor appetite for India\\'s growth trajectory and must need some reebuf from India’s young minds in positions of authority and constitutional obligation to serve this nation. It is painful and concerning to find that their commitment to nationalism is not what it should be. They take nationalism next to their political or self welfare. We have to nurture a spirit that nationalism has to be a prime concern. We have to always keep our nation first and above everything else. Nothing can be more challenging to democracy than an informed mind knowing full well the subject makes a wrong statement to monetize ignorance of the people. These people need to be exposed. You are well positioned to neutralise such nefarious tendencies. I am sure you will do it. There can be no politics over national affairs, security concerns and our foreign policy. The global rise of the nation has to be in your mind ever to ensure the momentum never loses force. My dear young friends, you can bring about transformation which has been dreamt because the system has generated enough equity for you to perform. Sardar Patel once said, \"Faith is of no avail in absence of strength. Faith and strength, both are essential to accomplish any great work.\"\\nHe further added in the constituent assembly “You will not have United India if not have good All India Service which has the independence to speak out its might.”\\nI read it there when I paid the floral tribute to Iron Man of this country. Never forget, he achieved what was very daunting, virtually impossible: integration of princely states. You need to be fully updated. Why Integration of Jammu and Kashmir was kept away from him. These two situations, Article 370 was kept away from Dr. Ambedkar. State of Jammu and Kashmir was taken away from the portfolio of Sardar Patel. And look at how we suffered for decades. You will be facing another situation which others have not faced. Though you will be at the junior-most level, the challenge will be more forceful to you. I am referring to disruptive technologies: artificial intelligence, internet of things, machine learning, blockchain, and the like. It is your obligation because we are at the cusp of something like another industrial revolution. These technologies will be the. These offer both challenges and opportunities. You will have to convert challenges into opportunities for public good. And I am sure you will do it. Congratulate each of you on this great positioning on this very rigorous training! If you had any serious thoughts about the Director and the faculty being unreasonable to you or harsh to you, you will be grateful to them all your life and remember them for good. They have to you. May you continue to inspire others, and mind each of you are role models for your families, for your friends, for your community, for your area, and you will be ever role model where you will be positioned at a particular place for a particular work and therefore, inspire others with your commitment and always strive to make a positive difference in the lives of those around you. Thank you.'),\n",

Humbled to be invited for this occasion. Gratifying to be amongst industry leaders and promising professionals of Bharat at this distinguished gathering today. The All India Management Association (AIMA) has emerged as a credible forum of convergence of industry captains and professionals to enhance networks of knowledge, skills and expertise including by rendering due recognition. The nomenclature-the AIMA Managing India Awards is exemplified and vindicated in action. Congratulations to the awardees for well deserved recognition. Their success stories will inspire and motivate many and collectively work towards India’s growth. There was a Chief Justice in the late 80s, Justice Venkat Ramaiya, a great judge. When he came to Rajasthan, I had the occasion, then in the 80s, to be President of the bar. Justice Venkat Ramaiya, the Chief Justice of India, said while he was speaking on contempt, \"There is another point of view in life. You must lend that point of view. You must not be instantly judgmental about it. Don\\'t drop that point of view with a drop of a hat because more often, the other point of view is the correct point of view, and the other point of view is a nectar\\xa0of life. These awards are indeed very special. These enhance affirmative public perception and influence. In this I must recognise the contribution of the distinguished jury. Time for all of us to reflect on the profound responsibilities while we celebrate the success stories of the awardees. The Greek Philosopher, Heraclitus हेराक्लीटस in pre Socrates era said “Change is the only constant in life.”\\xa0 Friends-We are amidst this change in its extremity and severity. The 21st century is already marked with precipitous changes. Disruptive technologies be it AI, IOT, blockchain, machine learning, 6G, Quantum Computing and the kind have made inroads virtually in every facet of human activity offering both opportunities and challenges. India is in the front line of nations in unleashing these technologies. National Quantum Mission with allocation of over Rs. Six Thousand Crore is already functional. This will seed, nurture and scale up scientific and industrial R&D and create a vibrant & innovative ecosystem in Quantum Technology. It is one such instance. There are many more like Green Hydrogen Mission, Commercialization of 6G and the like. It seems we are at the threshold of equivalent of another industrial revolution. The world is grappling with the speed, scale, complexity, and transformative power of these technologies. Now science fictions are fast taking shape of science facts and technology fusion is the main driver. Friends, historically, technological innovations have been considered as the main drivers for sustainable economic development and geometric productivity growth. Now the new breed of technology is required to be harnessed for substantial role in wealth creation and socio-political stability. These technologies have a potential to cause broader societal transformation by changing the existing economic sectors, tenets of work, production, and consumption. It lies, friends, in your domain to harness these technologies and convert challenges into opportunities. Building skills into the workforce of Industry is imperative. There is a dire need to identify and develop the disciplines and the required missing abilities in order to build suitable skills into the workforce of industry. One needs to step out of “bubble” to experience the environment of Hope and Possibility, the exponential growth and feel unstoppable upsurge. \"India has more Promise than any large country in this world\"\\nLast few years have been a period of epochal change for India. India is very much fast moving towards becoming a global superpower. Its rise is phenomenal and now unstoppable. Friends our Bharat, home to one sixth of humanity, is now-\\nFastest Growing Major Economy,\\nThe Fastest Growing Major Stock Market,\\nThe World\\'s Fastest Growing Startup Ecosystem. The Fastest Growing Startups Ecosystem,\\nThe Fastest Growing Real Estate Market. For development of nation, on one hand we are delving deep into the sea to make most of blue economy. On land, we are scratching beyond the surface. And in the sky and space, we are soaring high. There is no doubt that India is in full preparedness to emerge as a future global superpower and a global leader. Affirmative governance policies and initiatives have enhanced opportunity basket enabling industry to focus on this space of activity. Captains of industry and its workforce have significantly contributed in that change and shaped the future of our country. Today, I urge each one of you to recognize the pivotal role you play in shaping the next generation of leaders. Your mentorship, guidance, and unwavering support are indispensable in nurturing the talents of young, dynamic individuals and preparing them to assume leadership roles in their own right. I earnestly appeal you to support and handhold entrepreneurial dreams and aspirations in your own domains. Your wisdom, experience & guidance can help create an unparalleled enabling ecosystem. Collective wisdom of Indian Industry has potential to avail the great benefits of technology and new vistas of opportunities and its role is critical in India\\'s Marathon March to Vikasit Bharat@2047 to mark century of our independence. Even if some may not live to see the finish line, let\\'s dedicate ourselves to enjoying the journey and contributing to its grand success. Ladies and gentlemen, India has in recent years in the wake of severe head winds successfully traversed the extremely challenging terrain from being among the Fragile Five economies a decade ago to becoming the fifth largest global economy. India will be positioned as the third largest economy in the world by the turn of this decade, if not earlier. Friends, this is no small achievement. In 1991 our economy size was less than that of cities of London and Paris. Then our gold had to be physically pledged to two Swiss Banks. What a commendable journey with now nation being cosy with its foreign exchange reserves of over 600 billion US Dollars and occupying the slot of being fifth largest global economy. India has emerged as a land of hope and possibility, investment and opportunity for good reason. The IMF, WB and WEF accolades for our economic growth and digitisation penetration are indeed well premised, deserved and earned. Equitable development, transparent and accountable governance and zero accommodation for corruption are new norms. Adoption of technology, penetration of digitization, direct transfer and the like have contributed to decimation of corruption. This ecosystem fairly allows all to exploit their talent and expand their potential to realise aspirations. Now meritocracy prevails over anything else. Concept of Aspirational Districts, Smart Cities and Vibrant Villages define governance directions and futuristic outlook. Our urban centers have experienced remarkable progress and growth, as development has touched lives in all corners of the country. However, there is potential for further advancement in rural India. Embracing this opportunity for development not only fosters inclusivity but also brings about a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities across our nation. Eminent individuals of the industry and professionals such as yourselves have a pivotal role to play as partners in further enhancing this trend of equitable growth. Your insights, expertise, and vision are invaluable assets that can significantly impact the lives of citizens and shape the trajectory of our nation. Your partnership in governance can be transformational, transcending barriers and differences, to build a brighter, more inclusive future for all. Each of us, in our respective capacities, has a responsibility to give back to society. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is much beyond a legal obligation; it is a moral imperative and a powerful tool for social change. Industry is by and large gainfully channelising CSR. I urge you to harness the potential of CSR initiatives to touch lives, uplift communities, and drive sustainable development. Together, let us converge our collective efforts towards addressing pressing social issues, fostering innovation, and creating a legacy of positive change. In developed nations Research and Development is spurred by industry. Same is the situation when it comes to creation, development and nurturing of institutions of eminence. I have no doubt that our industry and professional leadership coupled with rich human resource can help us create world class R&D Centres and Institutions of eminence. Pooling of CSR funds for this purpose even by those at the top can do wonders. I am sure this suggestion is worth deliberation and consideration by the industry elite. Ladies and gentlemen, it is said that “Management is about doing things right, leadership is about doing right things”. But more importantly, there is also a caveat which says - “Quality of Leadership is reflected in the standards leaders set for themselves”. India will need constant concerted effort under that quality Leadership, to realize our collective resolve of Viksit Bharat by 2047, when the nation celebrates the centenary of its independence. I urge you to play your role relentlessly as catalysts of change! Time for us to pitch for economic nationalism and pledge to use locally manufactured products, as it conserve precious foreign exchange in billions of dollars apart from boosting employment and entrepreneurship. Avoidable imports driven by mere fiscal gain may improve your fiduciary balance sheet but will slur your societal commitment. Financial gain can never be justification for compromising national interest. Friends- same is the alarmingly worrisome scenario when raw materials as such without value addition are exported. I call upon industry, trade, business and commerce leadership and associations to nurture the spirit of economic nationalism - shun avoidable imports and curb raw material exports. Let us remember that with unprecedented rise of our nation comes even greater responsibility for us all. As leaders and influencers in your respective domains, I urge you to embrace this responsibility wholeheartedly and to commit yourselves to the noble cause of nation-building. Together, let us strive to leave behind a legacy of progress, compassion, and unity. I hope that these awards will inspire others to emulate your commitment, spirit and vision. I wish you all success in your future endeavours. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to honour the stalwarts. Jai Hind! *****\\nMS/RC/JK\\n'),\n",

This pioneering research demonstrates that AWS not only alleviates the symptoms of RA but also induces a metabolic shift towards normalisation in patients, offering a promising complementary approach to conventional treatments. The study was conducted by a group of senior researchers from reputed research institutions, including Arthritis Treatment and Advanced Research Center (A-ATARC), Department of Kaya Chikitsa, State Ayurvedic College and Hospital, Lucknow University; Centre of Biomedical Research (CBMR), SGPGIMS Campus, Lucknow; Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad. “This study is significant from the perspective of possible pathology reversal in case of RA being treated with whole system Ayurveda approach. This endorses ayurvedic concepts of ‘Samprapti Vighatan’ where a pathogenesis – disease complex is dismantled and ‘Doshas’ are brought back to normality.”, mentioned the first author Dr. Sanjeev Rastogi. Published in the PubMed-indexed research journal, Journal of Ayurveda and Integrated Medicine (JAIM), the study highlighted substantial improvements in key clinical parameters among RA patients who underwent AWS intervention. There was a notable reduction in Disease Activity Score-28 Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (DAS-28 ESR), as well as decreases in both the total number of swollen and tender joints. Additionally, the Ama Activity Measure (AAM) Score, which assesses the presence of toxins in the body, also showed a significant reduction post-intervention. The research further explored the metabolic profiles of RA patients, comparing them to healthy controls. At the study's outset, RA patients exhibited elevated levels of certain metabolites, including succinate, lysine, mannose, creatine, and 3-Hydroxybutyrate (3-HB), alongside decreased alanine levels. However, following AWS treatment, these metabolic markers began to shift towards the levels observed in healthy individuals, indicating a return to a more balanced metabolic state. As per the researchers, this study is the first of its kind to clearly demonstrate the clinical efficacy of AWS in managing RA. The intervention not only reduced symptoms but also promoted a metabolic environment conducive to homeostasis, potentially leading to long-term benefits for RA patients. While these findings are promising, the study's authors emphasise the need for further research to confirm these preliminary results and to better understand the mechanisms through which AWS exerts its therapeutic effects. This breakthrough underscores the potential of integrating traditional Ayurvedic practices with modern medical approaches to improve patient outcomes in chronic conditions like Rheumatoid Arthritis.

In a significant move to enhance and strengthen the agricultural infrastructure in the country and support the farming community, the Government has announced a series of measures to expand the scope of Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF) scheme. These initiatives aim at expanding the scope of eligible projects and integrate additional supportive measures to foster a robust agricultural infrastructure ecosystem. Viable Farming Assets: To allow all eligible beneficiaries of scheme for creation of infrastructure covered under 'viable projects for building community farming assets'. This move is expected to facilitate the development of viable projects that will enhance community farming capabilities, thereby improving productivity and sustainability in the sector. Integrated Processing projects: To include integrated primary secondary processing projects in list of eligible activities under AIF. However standalone secondary projects would not be eligible and would be covered under MoFPI schemes. PM KUSUM Component-A: To allow convergence of Component-A of PM-KUSUM with AIF for farmer/group of farmers/ Farmer Producer Organizations/ Cooperatives/ Panchayats. The alignment of these initiatives aims to promote sustainable clean energy solutions alongside the development of agricultural infrastructure. NABSanrakshan: In addition to CGTMSE, it is proposed to extend AIF credit guarantee coverage of FPOs through the NABSanrakshan Trustee Company Pvt. Ltd. also. This expansion of credit guarantee options is intended to enhance the financial security and creditworthiness of FPOs, thereby encouraging more investments in agricultural infrastructure projects. Since its launch by the Prime Minister in 2020, AIF has been instrumental in supporting creation of 6623 warehouses, 688 cold stores and 21 silos projects, resulting in additional storage capacity of about 500 LMT in the country. This includes 465 LMT of dry storage and 35 LMT of cold storage capacity. With this additional storage capacity 18.6 LMT of food grains and 3.44 LMT of horticulture produce can be saved annually. Rs. 47,575 Crore has been sanctioned for 74,508 projects under AIF till date. These sanctioned projects have mobilized an investment of Rs 78,596 Crore in agriculture sector, out of which Rs.78,433 Crore has been mobilised from private entities. In addition, infrastructure projects sanctioned under AIF have helped in generating more than 8.19 Lakh rural employment opportunities in the agriculture sector. The expansion in the scope of AIF scheme is poised to further drive the growth, improve productivity, enhance farm incomes and contribute to the overall sustainability of agriculture in the country. These measures also underscore the Government's\\xa0commitment to strengthening the agricultural sector through holistic development of farm infrastructure in the country. *****\\nMJPS/BM/SKS\\n\"),\n",

Background:\\nThe Government has been promoting blending of ethanol in petrol under the Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme wherein Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) sell petrol blended with ethanol. Under EBP Programme, the blending of ethanol with petrol increased from 38 crore litres in Ethanol Supply Year (ESY) 2013-14 to more than 500 crore litres in ESY 2022-23 with corresponding increase in blending percentage from 1.53% to 12.06%. The blending percentage has touched 15.83% in the month of July, 2024 and cumulative blending percentage has crossed 13% in the ongoing ESY 2023-24. OMCs are on course to achieve the 20% blending target by the end of ESY 2025-26. It is estimated that over 1100 crore litres of ethanol will be required during ESY 2025-26 to achieve 20% blending for which 1750 crore litres of ethanol distillation capacity needs to be installed to meet the blending requirement and for other uses (potable, chemical, pharmaceutical etc.). To meet the ethanol blending targets, the Government is also focusing on alternate sources like 2nd Generation (2G) Ethanol (Advanced biofuels). Surplus biomass /agricultural waste which has cellulosic and lignocellulosic content, industrial waste etc. can be converted to ethanol using advanced biofuel technology. To encourage 2G ethanol capacity in the country and attract investment in this sector, “Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN (Jaiv Indhan- Vatavaran Anukool fasal awashesh Nivaran) Yojana” was notified on 07.03.2019 for providing financial assistance to 2G Bio-ethanol projects. Under the scheme, the first 2G Ethanol Project set up by Indian Oil Corporation Limited at Panipat, Haryana has been dedicated to the nation by the Hon’ble Prime Minister on 10th August 2022. The other 2G commercial projects being set up by BPCL, HPCL and NRL at Bargarh (Odisha), Bathinda (Punjab) and Numaligarh (Assam) respectively, are also nearing completion. *****\\nMJPS/DS/BM/SKS\\n\"),\n",

Background:\\nInfrastructure development is the foundation for a country's economic prosperity and is critical for improving the quality of life of its citizens. Every rupee spent on infrastructure development has a multiplier effect of about 2.5-3.0 times on GDP. Realizing the importance of infrastructure in overall economic growth of the country, Government of India has been investing heavily in building world-class road infrastructure in the country over the last ten years. The length of National Highways (NH) has increased abourl.6 times from 0.91 lakh km in 2013-14 to 1.46 lakh km currently. There has been a significant increase in pace of award and construction of National Highways in the country in the last 10 years. For instance, the average annual pace of award of NH contracts has increased by 2.75 times from about 4,000 km in 2004-14 to about! 11,000 km in 2014-24. Similarly, the average annual construction of National Highways has also increased by about 2.4 times from about 4,000 km in 2004-14 to about 9,600 km in 2014-24. The total capital investment in National Highways including private investment has increased by 6 times from Rs. 50.000 Crore in 2013-14 to about Rs. 3.1 Lakh Crore in 2023-24. Further, Government has adopted a corridor-based highway infrastructure development approach with focus on ensuring consistent standards, user convenience and logistics efficiency, as compared to the earlier project-based development approach, focused on addressing stretches of local congestion. This corridor approach has led to the identification of a network of 50,000 km of High-Speed Highway Corridors through a scientific transport study based on GSTN and toll data to support India's transformation into a $30+ Trillion economy by 2047. ***\\nDS/BM/SKS\\n\"),\n",

Addressing the nation in the august presence of President of India Droupadi Murmu, Dr Jitendra Singh reflected on India’s remarkable achievements in Space exploration and its ambitious future goals in a majestic programme held at Bharat Mandapam. Dr Jitendra Singh highlighted the historic landing of Chandrayaan-3 on the Moon\\'s South Pole, a feat that astonished the world and established India as a leader in space exploration. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Minister recalled, had announced that August 23rd, 2023 would be celebrated nationwide as National Space Day, and the landing site of Chandrayaan-3 would be named ‘Shiv Shakti Point.’ The theme for this inaugural celebration, \"Touching Lives while Touching the Moon: India\\'s Space Saga,\" resonated throughout the event. \"In the last six decades, India has not only touched the lives of its citizens but also reached the Moon,\" said Dr. Jitendra Singh. He emphasized the significant progress made in the past decade, including the successful Mars Orbiter Mission, the launch of AstroSat, Chandrayaan-2, and Chandrayaan-3, the upcoming Aditya-L1 solar mission, and the XPoSat, an X-Ray astronomy mission. Dr. Jitendra Singh traced India’s Space journey beginning only 55 years back in 1969 when the US astronaut Neil Armstrong had already set his foot on the Moon. He lauded the scientific community for their unwavering dedication, which culminated in India becoming the first nation to land on the Moon\\'s South Pole. The Minister of State for Space credited the policy support and leadership provided by Prime Minister Modi since 2014 for accelerating scientific missions and unlocking the potential of India’s scientific community. He also noted the significant increase in Space startups, now numbering nearly 300, following the opening of the Space sector to private participation. He echoed the Finance Minister’s projection that India’s space economy will grow from $8 billion to $44 billion in the next decade. Dr. Jitendra Singh praised PM Modi for \"unshackling\" the space sector and making it more accessible to the public, as evidenced by the over 5,000 spectators and nearly 1,000 media personnel who witnessed the Chandrayaan-3 launch live at Sriharikota. Looking ahead, Dr. Jitendra Singh outlined the Space Vision 2047, which includes the commissioning of the Bharatiya Antariksha Station (BAS) by 2035 and Indian astronauts landing on the Moon by 2040. He expressed confidence that what begins with human spaceflight in Low Earth Orbit will expand to India’s own scientific activities onboard an indigenous space station, leading to further lunar exploration and beyond. Dr. Jitendra Singh highlighted India’s end-to-end capabilities in Space transportation, platforms, and ground stations were highlighted as a key aspect of the country’s self-reliance in the space sector.

In an exclusive interview to the Editor of the ‘OPEN\" magazine, Rajeev Deshpande, Dr Jitendra Singh said that the Modi government had broken the shackles of the past to liberate the Space Sector and the credit for this goes to Prime Minister Sh Narendra Modi. He further elaborated that for nearly 60-70 years, the Space sector was working behind a veil of self-imposed secrecy. That deprived the sector of resources and knowledge. We had no dearth of talent, he said. The 2023 new space policy was a watershed moment, said Dr Jitendra Singh. For the first time, he said, the private sector was allowed to participate in ISRO’s activities. Just before that, in 2020, an agency called In- SPACe was set up, which is an interface between government and private sectors. This was followed by the New Space India Limited to produce and assemble launch vehicles, he added.. According to the Minister for Space, there is an amazing enthusiasm about the developments. In 2021 or so, we had just one digit StartUp in the Space sector, and now we are nearing 300. Some of them are world-class, many are entrepreneurial stories. There is a Startup called AgniKul Cosmos that has set up a private launchpad in the ISRO premises, he said. They are reinforcing the ISRO infrastructure. There is Skyroot, which carried out the first-ever private sub-orbital launch. They are working on being the first to develop a rocket in the private sector. As a result, global companies like SpaceX are reaching out to Indian companies. According to Dr Jitendra Singh, all this is placing India as a frontline player in the private sector. Therefore, in 2023, we saw an in\\xadvestment of Rs.1000 crore. The projection is that the space economy will grow five times in the next 10 years or around $44 billion. Replying to a question regarding potential employment opportunities in the Space Sector, Dr. Jitendra Singh said, this might provide employment to talent that might have gone abroad. Our human resources were never lacking, he said. We have an institute in Thiruvananthapuram for space technology. The selection is on the basis of the IIT-JEE exam. The batches would get 100 percent placement, but 60-70 per cent would go to NASA. There were no avenues. Now, he said, there are not only avenues for employment, but exciting opportunities to begin a startup. A new area of livelihood has opened up. When asked about the important upcoming ISRO missions, the Minister for Space said that the immediate one will be \"Gaganyaan\", which was delayed due to Covid, but will now happen next year. The trial flights are going on. Then we have our robot flights, where a female robot, Vayumitra, will be sent to space in 2025. The robot will do all the activities of an astronaut and return to Earth and be extracted from the landing craft. If all goes well, says Dr Jitendra Singh, we can send an Indian human into Space, maybe in the second half of 2025. The Indian Space Station is planned by 2035. The first Indian to land on the moon may happen by 2040. ****\\nKSY/PSM\\n'),\n",

The primary objectives of the EOS-08 mission include designing and developing a microsatellite, creating payload instruments compatible with the microsatellite bus, and incorporating new technologies required for future operational satellites. Built on the Microsat/IMS-1 bus, EOS-08 carries three payloads: Electro Optical Infrared Payload (EOIR), Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry payload (GNSS-R), and SiC UV Dosimeter. The EOIR payload is designed to capture images in the Mid-Wave IR (MIR) and Long-Wave IR (LWIR) bands, both during the day and night, for applications such as satellite-based surveillance, disaster monitoring, environmental monitoring, fire detection, volcanic activity observation, and industrial and power plant disaster monitoring. The GNSS-R payload demonstrates the capability of using GNSS-R-based remote sensing for applications such as ocean surface wind analysis, soil moisture assessment, cryosphere studies over the Himalayan region, flood detection, and inland waterbody detection. Meanwhile, the SiC UV Dosimeter monitors UV irradiance at the viewport of the Crew Module in the Gaganyaan Mission and serves as a high-dose alarm sensor for gamma radiation. The spacecraft mission configuration is set to operate in a Circular Low Earth Orbit (LEO) at an altitude of 475 km with an inclination of 37.4°, and has a mission life of 1 year. The satellite has a mass of approximately 175.5 kg and generates power of around 420 W. It interfaces with the SSLV-D3 launch vehicle. EOS-08 marks a significant advancement in satellite mainframe systems such as an Integrated Avionics system, known as the Communication, Baseband, Storage, and Positioning (CBSP) Package, which combines multiple functions into a single, efficient unit. This system is designed with cold redundant systems using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components and evaluation boards, supporting up to 400 Gb of data storage. Additionally, the satellite includes a structural panel embedded with PCB, an embedded battery, a Micro-DGA (Dual Gimbal Antenna), an M-PAA (Phased Array Antenna), and a flexible solar panel, each serving as key components for onboard technology demonstration. The satellite employs a miniaturized design in its Antenna Pointing Mechanisms, capable of achieving a rotational speed of 6 degrees per second and maintaining a pointing accuracy of ±1 degree. The miniaturized phased array antenna further enhances communication capabilities, while the flexible solar panel incorporates a foldable solar panel substrate, GFRP tube, and CFRP honeycomb rigid end panel, offering improved power generation and structural integrity. A pyrolytic graphite sheet diffuser plate, known for its high thermal conductivity of 350 W/mK, reduces mass and finds application in various satellite functions. Furthermore, the EOS-08 mission adopts a new method of integrating housekeeping panels using a hinge-based fixture, significantly reducing the duration of the Assembly, Integration, and Testing (AIT) phase. Incorporating additional novel schemes, the EOS-08 mission improves satellite technology through X-band data transmission, utilizing pulse shaping and Frequency Compensated Modulation (FCM) for X-Band data transmitters. The satellite’s battery management system employs SSTCR-based charging and bus regulation, sequentially including or excluding strings at a frequency of 6 Hz. The mission’s indigenization effort is evident in its solar cell fabrication processes and the use of a Nano-Star Sensor for Microsat Applications. Additionally, the inertial system benefits from reaction wheel isolators that attenuate vibrations and a single antenna interface is utilized for TTC and SPS applications. Thermal management is enhanced using materials such as AFE BGA, Kintex FPGA, Germanium Black Kapton, and STAMET (Si-Al Alloy) Black Kapton to handle the thermal properties of COTS components. The mission also incorporates an auto-launch pad initialization feature, further demonstrating its commitment to innovative mission management.'),\n",

The team of senior officers of the Commission also visited these State/UT to review law and order situation, to ascertain State/ UT specific areas of concern, to discuss the quantum of Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) required in each State/ UT and to review the overall preparedness of the election machinery. The cooperation of all authorities was sought for conducting free, fair and peaceful elections across these State/UT under the overall superintendence, direction and control of the Commission. 4. The Kashmiri migrant electors registered in several parts of the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir, particularly Kashmir region, were forced to leave their native places during late 1980s and early 1990s because of terrorist activities of extremists supported from across the Indian borders. In view of this, the Commission, after consultation with the Central Government and the State Government came out with a scheme to enable these migrant electors to cast their vote from wherever they are residing in the country, by way of postal ballots since 1996 and voting in person at Special Polling Stations set up at Delhi, Udhampur and Jammu since 2002. Government of India vide notification dated 9th August, 2019 has abrogated Article 370 of the Constitution of India and promulgated the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Act, 2019 and Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir would now go for assembly elections the very first time since its inception. In view of this, the Commission has decided to extend the earlier scheme, for Kashmiri migrant electors from the UT of Jammu and Kashmir. Now, for migrant electors of Jammu and Udhampur, the filling of Form-M has been done away with to vote in person at Special Polling Stations. The electors staying in zones/camps will be mapped to their respective polling stations by the respective AERO Migrants at Jammu and Udhampur. For migrants who are residing outside Jammu and Udhampur, while they have to fill Form-M, they can now self-certify the certificate attached with the Form-M, instead of going through the hassle of getting it attested by a Gazetted officer. Additionally, the facility of voting through Postal Ballot for all those who cannot reach these Special Polling Stations shall also be available by filling Form 12C. 5. The conduct of General Elections in these State/UT requires considerable deployment of Central and State Police Forces to ensure peaceful, free and fair elections with fearless participation of electors, especially in vulnerable areas/pockets. Mobilization, deployment and disengagement of these forces with minimum crisscross movement and optimal utilization involved complex planning and detailed analysis, carried out over several rounds of consultations with the senior officers of the Ministry of Home Affairs/ CAPFs/ Police Nodal Officers of the State/ UT. 6.

In Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir all polling stations are located at ground floor and ramps with proper gradient are provided for the convenience of differently abled electors and senior citizens with wheelchairs. Further, in order to provide targeted and need-based facilitation to differently-abled voters, Commission has directed that all persons with disabilities and senior citizens in an Assembly Constituency are identified and tagged to their respective Polling Stations and necessary disability-specific arrangements made for their smooth and convenient voting experience on poll day. Identified PwD and senior citizens electors will be assisted by volunteers appointed by RO/DEO. Special facilitation will be made for PwD and senior citizens electors at Polling Stations. Also, it has been directed that differently abled electors & senior citizens are given priority for entering polling booths, provision be made for designated parking spaces close to the entrance of polling station premise and special facilitation extended to electors with speech and hearing impairment. Special focus has been laid on sensitization of polling personnel regarding special needs of the differently abled electors. Commission has directed the Chief Electoral Officers (CEOs) that there should be proper transport facility for PwD and senior citizens electors in each and every polling station on the day of poll. The PwD electors can request for wheelchair facility by registering on Saksham-ECI App. At the Polling Station, visually impaired persons can take a companion along with him/her to cast his/her vote on his/her behalf as provided in Rule 49 N of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.

The VABs will be set up with prominent signage and in such a manner that it will be conspicuous to the voters as they approach the polling premise/building to enable them to seek required facilitation on poll day. Alphabetic locator (as per English alphabet) generated with ERO-Net is placed at VAB to search the name easily and to know the serial number in the Electoral Roll. In order to maintain the secrecy of vote at the time of poll and to achieve uniformity in use of voting compartments, Commission instructed that the height of the Voting Compartments should be 30 inches and the Voting Compartment should be placed on a table whose height shall be 30 inches. Only corrugated sheet (flex board) of steel- grey colour, which is completely opaque and reusable, shall be used for making the voting compartments. The Commission hopes that the use of these standardized and uniform Voting Compartments in all the polling stations will translate into greater voter facilitation, ensure absolute secrecy of vote and eliminate aberrations and non-uniformity in the preparation of Voting Compartment inside the polling stations. The voting compartments shall also be pasted with self-adhesive stickers on three sides of the voting compartment depicting name of election, Name of State/UT, AC Number & name, P.S. number and Name, date of poll etc. The following procedures have also been made in the existing Guidelines for Voting through postal ballot by Absentee Voters in the category of Senior Citizens, PwDs and Covid-19 suspect or affected persons: -\\n\\nAs part of its firm commitment towards gender equality and greater constructive participation of women in the electoral process, the Commission has also directed that, to the extent possible, at least one polling station each managed exclusively by women and Persons with Disabilities shall be set up in every Assembly Constituency in poll going State of Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir. In such women managed Polling Stations, all election staff, including police and security personnel, will be women. Minimum one Model Polling Station per Assembly Constituency shall also be set up using and depicting local material and art forms.

Union of India & Others) and Writ Petition (Civil) No. 536 of 2011 (Public Interest Foundation & Ors. Vs. Union of India & Anr). The District Election Officers have been asked to prepare a comprehensive District Election Management Plan in consultation with SSPs/SPs and Sector Officers, including the route plan and the communication plan for conduct of elections. These will be vetted by the Observer, taking into account vulnerability mapping exercise and mapping of critical polling stations, in accordance with Election Commission of India’s extant instructions. Commission attaches great importance to preparation and implementation of a perfect communication plan at the district/constituency level for the smooth conduct of elections and to enable concurrent intervention and mid-course correction on the poll day. For the said purpose, the Commission has directed the Chief Electoral Officers of Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir to coordinate with the officers of Telecommunication Department in the State headquarter, BSNL authorities, the representatives of other leading service providers in the State so that network status in the State is assessed and communication shadow areas be identified. The CEOs have also been instructed to prepare the best communication plan in their State and make suitable alternate arrangements in the communication shadow areas by providing Satellite Phones, Wireless sets, Special Runners etc. Further, the Commission has also directed to improve the condition of connecting roads for smooth movement of polling parties, security forces, voters and other election machineries. In case of water ways, proper arrangements of boats/ferries etc. are to be ensured during election.

For enhancing electoral participation, the Commission has directed to take the following new initiatives:\\nThe CEOs/DEOs have been directed to identify Low voter turnout PSs/ACs/PCs and take focused initiatives to address specific issues. As the PS is the basic unit of election machinery, it has been directed to focus on district wise PSs for targeted interventions reaching out various groups like women, PWD, Transgender, PVTGs etc. The State have been directed to identify and engage local influential personalities as Election Icons. This would not only add value to the message of voter awareness as well as increase the general outreach in the specific region. As has been recently observed, the issue of Urban and Youth Apathy is a major concern for the Commission. Relatively low turnouts in urban areas need to be addressed by special interventions. Similarly, for youth, the awareness and engagement is required to be increased via appropriate mediums like ELCs, special registration camps, etc. Furthermore, Comprehensive SVEEP Plan, as per the new strategy document (SVEEP-IV) is directed to be prepared. Partnerships collaborations with various stakeholders should be forged with for greater outreach. Ensuring inclusion of all marginalized sections through targeted interventions, technological solutions and policy changes should be done.

Shri Narendra Modi brought the new Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana and since this scheme has come, you can compare it, earlier only 3.51 crore applications used to come, but now 8.69 crore applications have come because farmers have confidence. When the earlier government was in power, only 20 lakh applications used to come from non-loanee farmers, now 5.48 crore have come. The total farmer applications in the earlier government were 3.71 crore, which is now 14.17 crore. Farmers paid Rs 32,440 crore premium, while they were given a claim of Rs 1.64 lakh crore. Agriculture Minister Shri Shivraj Singh said that in the old crop insurance scheme, insurance was done compulsorily and the banks used to deduct the premium amount of the insurance on their own. Our government has removed this anomaly. Now if the farmer wishes, he can get insurance and if he does not wish, he should not. Shri Chouhan said that earlier the debt-free farmer did not get insurance, but now he can also get insurance if he wants. So far, 5 lakh 1 thousand hectares have been covered in it, which has increased to 5.98 lakh hectares in 2023, while 3.97 crore farmers have been covered and farmers are continuously adopting the crop insurance scheme. The government has taken many measures to simplify the scheme, so that farmers do not face any problem and trouble in taking advantage of the scheme. Union Minister Shri Chouhan said that another innovation has been done under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. Now it has been made mandatory to assess the loss not visually but through remote sensing at least 30 percent. Many times there is a delay in claim payment. If there is a delay, the insurance company will pay a 12% penalty, which will go directly to the farmer's account. If we look at the reasons for the delay, the biggest reason is the delay in releasing their share in premium subsidy by most states. He said that I request all the state governments not to delay in releasing their share. Many times the yield data is received late. In some cases, disputes arise between the insurance company and the states. Earlier there was a system that when the state government released its amount, only then the central government would give its share, but the central government has now made a provision and has de-linked itself from the state government's share, so now the Center will release its share immediately, so that there is no delay in the payment to the farmer. The farmer should at least get the amount from the Center on time. Mr. Chouhan said that the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana is for every district and every farmer of the entire country. There are 3 different models of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima and in those models the central government only makes the policy. The state government chooses the model it wants. This Fasal Bima Yojana is not necessary for every state, the states which want to adopt this scheme can adopt it and the states which do not want to adopt it cannot. At the same time, Mr. Chouhan said that the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana has not been implemented in Bihar yet. Bihar has its own scheme; they benefit their farmers according to that scheme. ******\\nSS\\n\"),\n",

In a significant move to enhance and strengthen the agricultural infrastructure in the country and support the farming community, the Government has announced a series of measures to expand the scope of Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF) scheme. These initiatives aim at expanding the scope of eligible projects and integrate additional supportive measures to foster a robust agricultural infrastructure ecosystem. Viable Farming Assets: To allow all eligible beneficiaries of scheme for creation of infrastructure covered under 'viable projects for building community farming assets'. This move is expected to facilitate the development of viable projects that will enhance community farming capabilities, thereby improving productivity and sustainability in the sector. Integrated Processing projects: To include integrated primary secondary processing projects in list of eligible activities under AIF. However standalone secondary projects would not be eligible and would be covered under MoFPI schemes. PM KUSUM Component-A: To allow convergence of Component-A of PM-KUSUM with AIF for farmer/group of farmers/ Farmer Producer Organizations/ Cooperatives/ Panchayats. The alignment of these initiatives aims to promote sustainable clean energy solutions alongside the development of agricultural infrastructure. NABSanrakshan: In addition to CGTMSE, it is proposed to extend AIF credit guarantee coverage of FPOs through the NABSanrakshan Trustee Company Pvt. Ltd. also. This expansion of credit guarantee options is intended to enhance the financial security and creditworthiness of FPOs, thereby encouraging more investments in agricultural infrastructure projects. Since its launch by the Prime Minister in 2020, AIF has been instrumental in supporting creation of 6623 warehouses, 688 cold stores and 21 silos projects, resulting in additional storage capacity of about 500 LMT in the country. This includes 465 LMT of dry storage and 35 LMT of cold storage capacity. With this additional storage capacity 18.6 LMT of food grains and 3.44 LMT of horticulture produce can be saved annually. Rs. 47,575 Crore has been sanctioned for 74,508 projects under AIF till date. These sanctioned projects have mobilized an investment of Rs 78,596 Crore in agriculture sector, out of which Rs.78,433 Crore has been mobilised from private entities. In addition, infrastructure projects sanctioned under AIF have helped in generating more than 8.19 Lakh rural employment opportunities in the agriculture sector. The expansion in the scope of AIF scheme is poised to further drive the growth, improve productivity, enhance farm incomes and contribute to the overall sustainability of agriculture in the country. These measures also underscore the Government's\\xa0commitment to strengthening the agricultural sector through holistic development of farm infrastructure in the country. *****\\nMJPS/BM/SKS\\n\"),\n",

Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)- Central Institute for Cotton Research (CICR), Nagpur conducted study to evaluate the impact of Bt. cotton in Maharashtra during 2012-13 and 2013-14. ICAR-CICR also conducted study on impact of Bt. cotton on soil ecology. During the period of survey the incidence of bollworms infestation reduced drastically and also decreases in number of insecticide application from 8 to 4. Further, ICAR-CICR studies had shown no adverse effect of Bt. cotton cultivation on soil ecological parameters. During the year 2023–24, in Andhra Pradesh State 4,73,345 farmers are cultivating Bt. cotton. The study conducted by ICAR-CICR observed an yield difference of 3-4 qtls/acre with the adoption of Bt. cotton. Further, ICAR-CICR study revealed that increase in income with the adoption of Bt. cotton is due to yield increase and reduction in insecticide cost against the cotton bollworm.

Shri Chouhan thanked and congratulated Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi who invited farmers on Independence Day. Shri Chouhan was addressing the program of dialogue with farmers invited to the Independence Day program and the launch of National Pest Surveillance System (NPSS). Ministers of State for Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Shri Ram Nath Thakur and Shri Bhagirath Choudhary and Secretary DARE and DG, ICA,R Dr. Himanshu Pathak were also present in the program. Paying his respects to the immortal revolutionaries, Shri Chouhan said that we all know that freedom was not presented to us on a silver platter. Thousands of people went to the gallows smilingly. They had a strong resolve in their hearts and they prayed to be given birth again on this land so that they could be of use to Mother India. Our immortal revolutionaries used to sing songs of freedom. Today, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi said that today there is no need to die for the country, but to live. Farmer brothers from every village of the country have come to the Independence Day celebrations. Farmers are the heartbeat of the country and the heartbeat of the people. Everyone's heart is beating because of what the farmers produce. Farmers are God for us. We have to make the food providers happy and prosperous. When Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister, he paid his respects to the farmers in every speech. The Union Agriculture Minister said that we will do 6 types of work under the leadership of the Prime Minister - Increasing production. We need to increase production, for that we need seeds. Recently, the Prime Minister dedicated 109 types of high yielding seeds to farmers. Farmers should be aware of the research done by scientists. Our job is to connect farmers and scientists. Many times, farmers do not have information, so they use the wrong pesticides. It is important to know about this. To ensure that farmers get the benefits of science immediately, we will start a program called Kisano Ki Baat once a month. This program will be on radio, scientists will sit in it, officials of the agriculture department will sit, he will also sit and farmers will be given information about whatever is necessary. There is a need to connect the Krishi Vijyan Kendra completely with the farmers. The work will be done to immediately deliver scientific benefits to the farmers. Now soon there will be discussions with scientists and discussions among farmers, so that we can do the miracle of becoming a food basket through agriculture. Shri Chouhan informed that earlier the budget for farmers was only Rs. 27 thousand crores, the Prime Minister increased this budget to Rs. 1.52 lakh crores. Farmers get fertilizers on subsidy. Nowadays, those people talk about farmers who have nothing to do with farming. They have not seen the fields, have not seen the crop in the field, they do not even know what a wheat ear looks like. The Union Agriculture Minister said that the government will buy all the tur, masoor, urad that the farmers grow. In the earlier times, there was no purchase at all,\\xa0 in the earlier government, only 6 lakh metric tons of pulses were purchased while the Modi government purchased 1.70 crore metric tons of pulses. Under the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, so far Rs. 3.24 lakh crore has been deposited in the accounts of farmers. PM Fasal Bima Yojna is the world's largest crop insurance scheme today. He will continuously try to keep improving it. We have to diversify agriculture. Farmers will benefit more from this. Shri Chouhan requested to the farmers to do natural farming in some part of their fields to improve the soil health. Shri Chouhan informed that a mission on this is coming very soon; its outline has been prepared. More FPOs should be formed. Through this, we can increase our income by doing many types of work. Shri Chouhan urged the farmers to start a new era under the leadership of our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. ****\\nSS\\n\"),\n",

Prime Minister also interacted with the farmers and scientists on the occasion. Discussing the importance of these new crop varieties, Prime Minister stressed on the significance of value addition in agriculture. The farmers said that these new varieties will be highly beneficial as they will help reduce their expenditure and also have a positive impact on the environment. Prime Minister discussed the importance of millets and underlined how people are moving towards nutritious food. The farmers appreciated the efforts undertaken by the government for promoting natural farming. Prime Minister suggested that KVKs should proactively inform farmers about the benefits of the new varieties being developed every month to enhance awareness about their benefits. The 109 varieties of 61 crops released by the Prime Minister included 34 field crops and 27 horticultural crops. Among the field crops, seeds of various cereals including millets, forage crops, oilseeds, pulses, sugarcane, cotton, fibre and other potential crops were released. Among the horticultural crops, different varieties of fruits, vegetable crops, plantation crops, tuber crops, spices, flowers and medicinal crops were released. Later, Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Shri Shivraj Singh Chouhan addressed the media, stating that today is significant for farmers since the 109 varieties of 61 crops that have been released will help them produce more, earn more money and spend less. Shri Chouhan said that the seeds of these crops are climate friendly and can yield good crop even in adverse weather. He also informed that these varieties are rich in nutrition. Today’s program is best example of lab to land program. Respond to inquiries from the media, Shri Shivraj Singh Chouhan declared that within three years, farmers will receive seeds from all 109 varieties. Additionally, he said that imports of exotic mango varieties are not currently necessary because our own variety is more productive, more aesthetically pleasing, and has superior keeping qualities, all of which can increase farmers' income. All of these types are appropriate for natural farming, and research on this topic is ongoing. On one day each month, the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, proposed that experts from KVK, ICAR, and state agricultural universities engage with farmers. The goal of this exchange should be to tackle a current issue related to agriculture and attempt to identify answers through mutual learning.

If the farmer is a producer, then he is also the biggest consumer. The farmer buys something and that increases the GDP. Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare said that the top priority of Modiji is the farmer. We have been saying that we will increase the income of farmers and strengthen the agriculture sector. The roadmap for increasing income of farmers is –\\n1 - Increasing production 2 - Reducing production cost 3 - Giving fair price for agricultural produce 4 - Compensation for loss in natural disaster 5 - Diversification of agriculture, not just traditional crops, fruits, flowers, medicine, beekeeping, value addition, making different things from raw material and 6 - Natural farming. We are continuously working on these 6 dimensions under the leadership of Modi ji. Shri Chouhan said that if we want to increase production and reduce cost, we need good seeds. Due to climate change, the temperature of the earth's surface is increasing. We need such seeds that are climate friendly, can give proper yield, use of pesticides is reduced. Producing seeds, making seeds by doing research, this work is very important. ICAR is continuously engaged in this work. Recently 109 varieties of seeds have been prepared. 23 varieties of cereals, 9 of rice, 2 of wheat, 1 of barley, 6 of maize, 1 of sorghum, 1 of millet, 1 of ragi, 1 of chheena, 1 of samba, 2 of tur, 2 of gram, 3 of lentil, 1 of peas, 2 of moong, 7 varieties of overall oilseeds. 7 varieties of fodder, \\xa07 varieties of sugarcane, 5 of cotton, 1 of jute, 40 varieties of horticulture. The Union Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister said that our scientists have done research and have developed a variety of rice that gives higher yield and requires 20% less water. Efforts have also been made to reduce pest infestation along with production. Shri Chouhan informed that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will release 109 crop varieties in Pusa, Delhi on 11th August, 2024. There are different varieties for different agro-climatic zones. Seed varieties have been prepared for area specific crops. There is no big program for release, rather the Prime Minister will go to the field and release the crops. Tomorrow the Prime Minister will visit ICAR fields and release seed varieties at three places. Shri Chouhan said that lab to land, science should reach the farmer directly, the benefit of research should reach the farmer. Efforts have been made to have everything at one place.The Union Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister said that I am happy to say that the agriculture budget which used to be around Rs. 27 thousand crores in the UPA government, is now Rs. 1.52 lakh crores including allied sectors. Last year, a subsidy of Rs. 1 lakh 95 thousand crores was provided on fertilizers. The Union Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister said that this year there is a provision of subsidy of 1 lakh 70 thousand crores, but if the consumption increases, then it will also increase. Shri Chouhan said that this year a special package of 2,625 crores has been given, because due to international conditions, the fertilizer ships have to take a detour. This also takes time, so that that burden does not fall on the farmer, this special package has been given.The Union Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister further said that irrigation is important in agriculture, for this there is a budget of the Ministry of Water Power, it is also for the water of the fields. Shri Chouhan said that unprecedented provision has been made in agriculture. The Cabinet has made a provision to build 2 crore houses for the poor in rural areas. The Union Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister said that horticulture is also important in the field of agriculture. The fruit plants are not made from seeds, but from cuttings. If there is a virus in the original cutting, then the virus also spreads to the other cuttings. For this, Rs. 1,700 crore has been approved for the Clean Plant Program. We have a complete system for the farmers who will cultivate fruits in the field of horticulture, 9 centers will be built for this. Shri Chouhan said that efforts are being made to continuously improve the field of agriculture and rural development. ******\\nSS\\n\"),\n",

The Government has made several interventions for ensuring better transparency, accountability, timely payment of claims to the farmers and to make the scheme more farmer friendly, as a result of which the area and farmers covered under the scheme in 2023-24 is at all-time high. The scheme is now the largest in the world in terms of farmer applications insured. As per provisions of PMFBY guidelines, the premium share of the farmer is capped at 2% for Kharif crops, 1.5% for Rabi Crops and 5% for commercial/Horticultural crops. Some States have further waived off farmer’s share of premium due to which there is very less burden on the farmers. As against the total reported claims of Rs.1,67,475 crore under the scheme, Rs.1,63,519 crore (98%) have already been paid. Settlement of few claims in some States got slightly delayed due to reasons like late release of State share in premium subsidy by the States delayed transmission of yield data, yield related disputes between insurance companies and States, non-receipt of account details of some farmers for transfer of claims to the bank account of eligible farmers and National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT) related issues, erroneous/incomplete entry of individual farmers data on National Crop Insurance Portal (NCIP), delay in remittance of farmers share of premium/non-remittance of farmers share of premium to concerned insurance company etc. It has been observed that majority of pending claims remain unpaid on account of delay by States in releasing their share of premium subsidy. Taking cognizance of this, Government of India is releasing its share of premium subsidy in advance by delinking the same from release of State Government’s share. Accordingly, claims are released by the Insurance Companies on pro-rata basis, so that the farmer does not suffer. Further, as per provisions of revamped Operational Guidelines of the scheme, \\xa0insurance companies are required to pay penal interest @12% per annum to the farmers for the period beyond the period stipulated in the PMFBY Guidelines from the date of receipt of final yield data from the State Government and completion of crop damage survey. Department has been regularly monitoring the functioning of insurance companies, including timely settlement of claims through weekly video conferencing of all stakeholders, one to one meeting as well as National Review Conferences. In order to rigorously monitor claim disbursal process, a dedicated module namely ‘Digiclaim Module’ has been operationalized for payment of claims from Kharif 2022 onwards. It involves integration of National Crop Insurance Portal (NCIP) with PFMS and accounting system of Insurance Companies to provide timely & transparent processing of all claims.

These are as follows:\\nBased on examination of requests received, permission are granted to the fertilizer companies for increasing their manufacturing capacity which are under NBS and for induction of new P&K companies & their fertilizer products under NBS, with a view to boost manufacturing and make country self-reliant in fertilizer production. Potash derived from Molasses (PDM) which is 100% indigenously manufactured fertilizer has been notified under Nutrient based subsidy (NBS) regime w.e.f 13.10.2021. With regards to Urea, the Government had announced New Investment Policy (NIP) to facilitate fresh investment in the urea sector and to make India self-sufficient in the urea sector. Total 6 new urea units have been set up under the policy which includes 4 urea units set up through Joint Venture Companies (JVC) of nominated PSUs and 2 urea units set up by the private companies. The units set up through JVC are Ramagundam urea unit of Ramagundam Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd (RFCL) in Telangana and 3 urea units namely Gorakhpur, Sindri and Barauni of Hindustan Urvarak & Rasayan Limited (HURL) in Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Bihar, respectively. The units set up by private companies are Panagarh urea unit of Matix Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd. (Matix) in West Bengal; and Gadepan-III urea unit of Chambal Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd. (CFCL) in Rajasthan. Each of these units has installed capacity of 12.7 Lakh Metric Tonne per annum (LMTPA). These units are highly energy efficient as they are based on latest technology. Therefore, these units have together added urea production capacity of 76.2 LMTPA thereby total indigenous urea production capacity(Reassessed Capacity, RAC) has increased from 207.54 LMTPA during 2014-15 to 283.74 LMTPA at present. Further, an exclusive policy for the revival of Talcher unit of FCIL through JVC of nominated PSUs namely Talcher Fertilizers Limited (TFL) by setting up a new Greenfield urea plant of 12.7 LMTPA at coal gasification route has also been approved. In addition, The Government also notified the New Urea Policy (NUP) – 2015 on 25th May, 2015 for the existing 25 gas-based urea units with one of the objectives of maximizing indigenous urea production beyond RAC. The NUP-2015 has led to additional production of urea by 20-25 LMTPA as compared to the production during 2014-15 annually. These steps together have facilitated increase of Urea production from level of 225 LMT per annum during 2014-15 to a record Urea Production at 314.09 LMT during 2023-24. The Government is recommending soil test based balanced and integrated nutrient management through conjunctive use of both inorganic and organic sources (manure, bio-fertilizers etc.) of plant nutrients to reduce the use of chemical fertilizers preventing deterioration of soil health, environment and contamination of groundwater. In addition, split application and placement of fertilizers, use of slow releasing N-fertilizers and nitrification inhibitors, growing leguminous crops and use of Resource Conservation Technologies (RCTs) are also advocated. Indian Council of Agricultural Research imparts training, organizes front-line demonstrations and undertakes public campaigns to educate farmers on all these aspects. In order to promote use of organic sources of fertilizers, Government has developed several technologies and carried out technology dissemination activities. Several organic waste recycling and enrichment technologies have been developed. In order to enhance bio-fertilizer use, ICAR has developed improved and efficient strains of bio-fertilizers specific to different crops and soil types. Liquid Bio-fertilizer technology with higher shelf-life has also been developed. These are available for use by farmers and other stakeholders. The ICAR also imparts training to educate farmers and provide technical backstopping to Governmental schemes in this regard. The Government has also approved Market Development Assistance @ ₹1,500/MT to promote organic fertilizers, produced at plants under umbrella Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources Dhan (GOBARdhan) initiative covering different Biogas/CBG support schemes/programmes of stakeholder Ministries/Departments such as Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) scheme of Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas (MoP&NG), ‘Waste to Energy’ programme of Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE), Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) of Department of Drinking Water & Sanitation (DDWS), etc. Also, for promotion of organic and bio-fertilizers, Government has requested all fertilizer marketing companies to arrange for mandatory off-take of Fermented Organic Manure (FOM) and other organic & bio-fertilizer with chemical fertilizer as a “Basket Approach” to ensure balanced and Integrated Nutrient Management for the Crops.

Under the NBS scheme, a fixed amount of subsidy, decided on an annual/bi-annual basis, is provided on subsidized P&K fertilizers depending on their nutrient content including Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP). Under this scheme, MRP is fixed by fertilizer companies as per market dynamics at a reasonable level which is monitored by the Government. The P&K sector is decontrolled and under the NBS scheme the companies are free to take initiatives to produce/import fertilizers as per market dynamics. Further, in order to ensure smooth availability of DAP at affordable prices to farmers, the Government has provided special packages on DAP over and above the NBS subsidy rates on need basis. Recently, in 2024-25, due to geo-political situation, adversely affecting the viability of procurement of DAP by the fertilizer companies, the Government has approved One-time special package on DAP beyond the NBS rates on actual PoS (Point of Sale) sale of DAP for the period from 01.04.2024 till 31.12.2024 @ ₹ 3500 per MT to the P&K fertilizer companies to ensure sustainable availability of DAP at affordable prices to the farmers. Further, the guidelines on evaluation of reasonableness of MRPs fixed by the P&K Fertilizer companies also ensure availability of fertilizers at affordable prices to farmers. Urea, is provided to the farmers at a statutorily notiﬁed Maximum Retail Price (MRP). The MRP of 45 kg bag of urea is Rs.242 per bag (exclusive of charges towards neem coating and taxes as applicable) and the MRP has remained unchanged since 01.03.2018 to till date. The difference between the delivered cost of urea at farm gate and net market realization by the urea units is given as a subsidy to the urea manufacturer/importer by the Government of India. Accordingly, all farmers are being supplied urea at subsidized rates. Indian Council of Agricultural Research has assessed the impact of long-term use of chemical fertilizers in different soil types under dominant cropping systems. The investigation over the last few decades indicated that in NPK alone system (chemical fertilizer alone), nutritional disorders in terms of deficiency of micro and secondary nutrients surfaced affecting soil health and crop productivity. Inorganic fertilizer + organic manure at recommended dose sustained crop yield and soil fertility. Highest decline in crop yield was observed in plot receiving imbalanced fertilization and only urea. Therefore, ICAR is recommending soil test based balanced and integrated nutrient management practices through conjunctive use of both inorganic and organic sources. The Government has implemented “PM Programme for Restoration, Awareness Generation, Nourishment, and Amelioration of Mother-Earth (PM-PRANAM)” from June, 2023 to support the mass movement started by States/UTs to save the health of Mother Earth by promoting sustainable and balanced use of fertilizers, adopting alternate fertilizers, promoting organic farming and implementing resource conservation technologies. Under the said scheme, 50% of the fertilizer subsidy saved by a State/UT in a particular financial year by way of reduction in consumption of chemical fertilizers (Urea, DAP, NPK, MOP) compared to previous 3 years’ average consumption, will be passed on to that State/UT as Grant. Further, the Government has approved the Market Development Assistance (MDA) @ Rs. 1500/MT to promote organic fertilizers, i.e. manure produced at plants under GOBARdhan initiative covering different Biogas/CBG support schemes/programmes of stakeholder Ministries/Departments such as Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) scheme of Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG), ‘Waste to Energy’ programme of Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE), Swachh Bharat Mission (Rural) of Department of Drinking Water & Sanitation (DDWS), etc. with total outlay of Rs.'),\n",

Above steps together have facilitated an increase of Urea production from level of 225 LMT per annum during 2014-15 to a record Urea Production at 314.07 LMT during 2023-24. With regard to P &K fertilizers, the Government has implemented Nutrient Based Subsidy Policy w.e.f. 1.4.2010 for Phosphatic and Potassic (P&K) Fertilizers. Under the policy, a fixed amount of subsidy, decided on an annual/bi-annual basis, is provided on notified P&K fertilizers depending on their nutrient content. The P&K sector is decontrolled and the fertilizer companies manufacture/import fertilizer as per the market dynamics. To make country self-reliant in fertilizer production, THE following measures have been taken:\\nAs a result of these steps, production of DAP has increased from 38.99 LMT in 2018-19 to 42.93 LMT in 2023-24, while during the same period, the production of NPKs has increased from 89.98 LMT to 95.48 LMT by 22 P&K fertilizer manufacturing units. Similarly, production of SSP increased from 40.72 LMT in 2018-19 to 44.44 LMT in 2023-24 by 104 SSP manufacturing units. The Economic Survey 2023-24 states that the Indian Agriculture sector provides livelihood support to about 42.3 percent of the population and has a share of 18.2 per cent in the country’s GDP at current prices. Fertilizers, water and seeds are vital inputs for achieving higher agricultural production in the country. Government has undertaken various efforts during the last decade due to which the total fertilizer production has increased from 385.39 LMT in 2014-15 to 503.35 LMT in 2023-24. Several measures were undertaken by the Government such as Urea Subsidy Scheme, New Urea Policy 2015, Nutrient based Subsidy scheme etc. to increase the total fertilizer production in the country. Besides, it also promotes sustainable methods such as the use of alternative fertilizers viz., Nano Urea, Nano DAP and organic fertilizer in the country.

The Scheme is wholly financed by the Government of India through Budgetary Support. Urea Subsidy Scheme has three components, i.e., Indigenous Urea, Imported Urea and Uniform Freight Subsidy. Indigenous urea subsidy is administered to the urea units towards indigenous urea production. Imported Urea subsidy is directed towards imports made to bridge the gap between assessed demand and indigenous production of urea in the country. Both components also include freight subsidy for movement of urea across the country under the Uniform Freight Subsidy Policy. Under the Urea Subsidy Scheme, Urea is presently provided to the farmers at a statutorily notified Maximum Retail Price (MRP). The MRP of 45 kg bag of urea is Rs.242 per bag (exclusive of charges towards neem coating and taxes as applicable). The difference between the delivered cost of urea at farm gate and net market realization by the urea units is given as subsidy to the urea manufacturer/importer by the Government of India. The current Urea policies by which subsidy is being paid are New Pricing Scheme (NPS)-III, Modified NPS-III, New Investment Policy (NIP) – 2012 and New Urea Policy (NUP) – 2015. Accordingly, all farmers of the country are being supplied urea at the subsidized rates and thereby are beneficiaries of this scheme.

During 2023-24, in India domestic coal production increased to 997.26 Million Tonnes (MT) registering thereby a growth of 11.65% over last financial year (2022-23). In the current financial year till July 2024, coal production was 321.41 MT registering 9.6% growth compared to the same period of last financial year. However, as per the existing import policy, coal is kept under the Open General License (OGL) and consumers are free to import coal from the source of their choice as per their contractual agreement on payment of applicable duty. Government has initiated several measures to ramp up domestic coal production and to substitute coal imports. (i) The Annual Contract Quantity (ACQ) has been increased upto 100% of the normative requirement, in the cases where the ACQ was either reduced to 90% of normative requirement (non-coastal) or where the ACQ was reduced to 70% of normative requirement (coastal power plants). Increase in the ACQ would result in more domestic coal supplies, thereby, reducing the import dependency. (ii) Under the provisions of Para B (viii) (a) of SHAKTI Policy, coal linkage is provided for short term for sale of power generated through that linkage through any product in Power Exchanges or in short term through a transparent bidding process through DEEP portal. In addition, with the amendment to the Non-Regulated Sector (NRS) linkage auction policy introduced in 2020, the tenure of coking coal linkages in the NRS linkage auction has been revised for a period upto 30 years. The coal offered for short term to the Power Plants under the amended provisions of SHAKTI Policy as well as increase in the tenure of the coking coal linkages in the NRS linkage auction for a period upto 30 years is expected to have a positive impact towards coal imports substitution. (iii) Government has decided in 2022 that the coal to meet the full PPA requirement of all the existing linkage holders of Power Sector shall be made available by the coal companies. The decision of the Government of meeting the full PPA requirement of the linkage holders of the Power Sector shall reduce the dependence on the imports. (v) An Inter - Ministerial Committee (IMC) has been constituted in the Ministry of Coal on 29.05.2020 for the purpose of coal import substitution. The Representatives from Ministry of Power, Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Shipping, Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Steel, Ministry of Mines, Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME), Department for Promotion of Industry & Internal Trade (DPIIT), Central Electricity Authority (CEA), Coal Companies and Ports are members of this IMC. Eleven meetings of the IMC have been held so far. On the directions of the IMC, an Import Data System has been developed by Ministry of Coal to enable the Ministry to track the imports of coal. Efforts are taken to ensure more domestic supplies of coal.

This visionary programme seeks to create new industrial cities as \"Smart Cities,\" where next-generation technologies seamlessly integrate across various infrastructure sectors. By fostering the development of these futuristic industrial hubs, the Government of India is positioning the country as a global leader in manufacturing and investment, rivalling the world\\'s top destinations. Central to this strategy is the development of integrated industrial corridors designed to accelerate growth in the manufacturing sector and promote systematic urbanisation. These corridors, supported by robust multi-modal connectivity and developed in collaboration with State Governments, are set to drive employment opportunities, economic growth, and overall socio-economic development across the nation. Background\\nThe National Industrial Corridor Development Programme began with the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) launch. The Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor Development Corporation (DMICDC) Limited was established on 7th January 2008 as a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) under the administrative control of the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), Ministry of Commerce & Industry. Its primary mission was to oversee project development activities and coordinate the implementation of various initiatives under the DMIC. In December 2016, the scope of the DMIC Trust was broadened, leading to its reconstitution as the National Industrial Corridor Development and Implementation Trust (NICDIT). As a result, in February 2020, DMICDC Ltd. was renamed the National Industrial Corridor Development Corporation (NICDC) Limited. This change marked a significant milestone in India\\'s flagship ‘National Industrial Corridor Programme,’ with NICDC entrusted to spearhead the development of multiple industrial corridor projects across the country. NICDC\\'s mandate includes project development activities for a wide range of initiatives, including investment regions, industrial areas, economic zones, industrial nodes, townships, integrated manufacturing clusters, and standalone or early-stage projects. It also provides vital support to various State Governments in these endeavours. NICDC’s role extends to comprehensive project development, including preparing master plans, feasibility reports, and detailed project reports. Additionally, it acts as a key intermediary in developing and establishing infrastructure projects, facilitating the creation and distribution of financial instruments, negotiating loans, and designing schemes for resource mobilisation and credit extension for infrastructure development.

At the anniversary event, the trade policy think tank of the Government released the Special Issue of the Global Trade and Customs Journal (GTCJ) and its Seventh Anniversary Magazine on “India’s G20 Presidency”. The event was graced byG20 Sherpa, Government of India, Shri Amitabh Kant; Commerce Secretary, Shri Sunil Barthwal; Additional Secretary, Department of Commerce, Shri L. Satya Srinivas; andVice Chancellor, Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT), Shri Rakesh Mohan Joshi. The event marked the seventh foundation day of CTIL asa government think tank and advisory body. CTIL was established in the year 2016, by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India, to develop international trade and investment law capacity in the country,and provide the government with sound and rigorous legal analysis of international trade and investment law issues. Since its inception, CTIL has been regularly advising the Department of Commerce and other governmental departments and agencies on emerging issues in international economic law, with a focus on WTO law and bilateral trade agreements. In its time, the Centre has provided over 2,500 advisory opinions to the Government of India on various international trade issues, including inputs on bilateral engagements. In his keynote address, India’s G20 Sherpa Shri Amitabh Kant highlighted the importance of the G20 as a premier forum for major economies to address major issues, such as international financial stability, climate change mitigation and sustainable development.He pointed out that despite the critical role of the Global South and emerging markets, various global economic forums and institutional banks failed to address the concerns of these nations and their views on climate change and sustainability. As India’s G20 Sherpa, he provided his insights on how the Indian G20 Presidency with its inclusion of the African Union will shape the direction of international economics, sustainable development, and financial growth in an inclusive manner. Shri Kant noted that the G20 operates without a permanent secretariat, and the presidency provides functional support and operates on a consensus-based system. This is crucial as there was 100% consensus on all the 83 paragraphs in the New Delhi Leaders’ Declaration, he added. The Sherpa also applauded CTIL and its young and multidisciplinary lawyers on the work they have been doing for the Department of Commerce, in the fields of international trade and investment law. Addressing the trade and investment law community and policymakers, Union Commerce SecretaryShri Sunil Barthwal pointed out the relevance of the Global South and the need to integrate the needs of developing and Least Developed Countries into the global trade system. In particular, he mentioned the upcoming Global South Summit and African Summit as forums that can find ways to bring the concerns of these countries to a global level. The Secretary observed that non-trade issues have increasingly been emerging in trade negotiations, raising the need for cross-disciplinary capacity building in FTA negotiations for India and other developing countries. The Centre for Trade and Investment Law (CTIL) was established in the year 2016 by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India, at the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT). The Centre’s primary objective is to provide sound and rigorous analysis of legal issues pertaining to international trade and investment law to the Government of India and other governmental agencies. The Centre is aiming to create a dedicated pool of legal experts who could provide technical inputs for enhancing India's participation in international trade and investment negotiations and dispute settlement. The Centre also aims to be a thought leader in the various domains of international economic law such as WTO law, international investment law and legal issues relating to economic integration. ***\\nAD\\n\"),\n",

Speaking about the rapid growth of China, Shri Goyal said that India is at the same sweet spot today as China was between 2000-2020 when they grew at 8% based on a stable economy and low inflation. “Our political and social problems will eventually reduce, our economy will grow faster and we can replicate China’s growth story”, said the Union Minister. Speaking on ethical wealth creation and the need for private investment, Shri Goyal lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s commitment to recognise the contribution of wealth creators in the private sector and businesses. “PM Modi values wealth creators for their role in job creation and for providing goods and services for the citizens”, he said. He further added that the PM's speech at CII Post-Budget Conference has brought to the fore the importance of manufacturing to India’s growth story and the need for stable policies to make India a developed nation by 2047. ***\\nAD/NS/AM\\n\"),\n",

The Government of India, through Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) and other Central Ministries/ Departments, provides an enabling eco-system for the overall industrial development of the country through appropriate policy interventions. In addition to on-going schemes of other Ministries/ Departments, this Department has taken various steps for promotion and facilitation of\\xa0 industries across States/UTs, which includes Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, such as Make in India, Start-up India, PM GatiShakti, National Industrial Corridor Programme, Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme, promoting Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) and reducing compliance burden, National Single Window System (NSWS), India Industrial Land Bank, Project Monitoring Group (PMG), liberalization of FDI policy, Indian Footwear and Leather Development Programme (IFLDP) Scheme, etc. An institutional mechanism to fast-track investments has been put in place, in the form of Project Development Cells (PDCs), in all concerned Ministries/ Departments of Government of India. In addition, the Government has implemented various measures to stimulate Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows. The Government has put in place an investor friendly policy, wherein most sectors except certain strategically important sectors, are open for 100% FDI under the automatic route. Almost 90% of the FDI inflow is received under the automatic route. India continues to open up its economy to global investors by raising FDI limits, removing regulatory barriers, developing infrastructure and improving business environment. The Government has taken initiatives to simplify, rationalize, digitize and decriminalize Government to Business (G2B) and Citizen Interface across all the States/UTs with the objective to improve Ease of Doing Business and Ease of Living. So far, more than 42,000 compliances have been reduced and more than 3,800 provisions have been decriminalized. Jan Vishwas (Amendment of Provisions) Act, 2023 was introduced to further the trust-based governance and enable de-criminalization of minor offences and compliance-based laws and requirements. The Act decriminalized 183 provisions under 42 Acts administered by 19 Ministries/Departments. India ranks 63rd in the World Bank’s Doing Business Report (DBR), 2020 published in October, 2019. India’s rank in the DBR improved from 142nd in 2014 to 63rd in 2019, registering a jump of 79 ranks in a span of 5 years. The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) has developed the National Single Window System (NSWS) portal as a one-stop for taking all the regulatory approvals and services in the country. NSWS platform aims to streamline the G2B ecosystems and further promote ease of doing business in India. The platform promotes Accountability, Information Symmetry and Transparency within the G2B ecosystem by providing a national portal, PAN based verification and registration and access to more than 270+ G2B services at the central level. Thus, it also eliminates the need for multiple interfaces and registrations for businesses to avail requisite G2B services. The national portal integrates the existing clearance systems of the various Ministries/ Departments of Govt. of India and State Governments. Currently, approvals of 32 Central Ministries/ Departments and 28 States/UTs Single Window Systems have been integrated with the NSWS Portal. A total of 277 Central approvals and 2,977 state approvals can be applied through NSWS. Information pertaining to 653 central approvals and 6,198 state approvals are available to businesses via the Know Your Approval (KYA) module of NSWS. This information has been provided by the Union Minister of State for Commerce and Industry, Shri Jitin Prasada in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today. ***\\nAD\\n'),\n",

While attending the launch of a report on \\'Net Impact of E-Commerce on Employment and Consumer Welfare in India\\' of Pahle India Foundation as the Chief Guest in New Delhi today, the Minister said that the growth of e-commerce must democratize the distribution of benefits amongst the larger section of society. Shri Goyal said that technology is a means to empower, to innovate and means to meet consumer requirements - sometimes more efficiently. But this growth must be in an orderly fashion, he said, adding that in the race for market share, we must not cause disruption for the 100 million small retailers across the country. Shri Goyal underscored the importance of protecting India\\'s developing economy and supporting those who still need affirmative action. \"There’s a large section out there who still deserves our help. When it comes to jobs and opportunities for the future of India, I think all of us will have to play our part,\" he said. Shri Goyal expressed his concerns regarding the growing influence of e-commerce on India\\'s traditional retail sector and its potential impact on employment. The Minister highlighted the possibility that half of India\\'s market could become part of the e-commerce network in the next decade, a development he described as \"a matter of concern.\"\\nReflecting on the broader implications of e-commerce, Shri Goyal urged a dispassionate and data-driven analysis of its impact. Drawing comparisons with the Western countries, Shri Goyal noted the decline of traditional \"mom and pop\" stores in countries like the United States and Europe due to the rise of e-commerce. He pointed out that Switzerland has a cautious approach to e-commerce. \"I’m not wishing away e-commerce. It\\'s here to stay,\" Shri Goyal emphasized, \"but we have to think very carefully and cautiously about its role. Is predatory pricing good for the country?”\\nThe Minister expressed his concern about the impact of e-commerce on local businesses and employment, particularly in sectors like pharmacies and mobile phone repair shops. Concluding his remarks, he urged the business community and experts to carefully study and evaluate the impact of E-commerce in context of needs of the country in a detailed and scientific manner. ***\\n\\nAD/VN\\n'),\n",

This was stated by Union Commerce and Industry Minister, Shri Piyush Goyal at the 10th India International MSME Startup Expo & Summit 2024 in New Delhi today. Shri Goyal said that innovative ideas and new ways of doing things are the hallmark of the entrepreneurs of MSMEs. The entire ecosystem around big industries and enterprises comprises of thousands of MSMEs, without whom they cannot succeed, he said adding that MSMEs act both as a suppliers and customers of big industries. Shri Goyal pointed out that MSMEs play an important role in tourism and infrastructure development of the country and have a big share in India’s exports. The growth of this sector is vital for the country and a focus area for the government, he said. Commerce Minister said that when 140 crore countrymen get together to contribute in nation building, India will become a developed nation by 2047 and we can ensure prosperity for all. Shri Goyal highlighted the fact that through Quality Control Orders (QCO) the government is supporting the MSME sector. “We are giving time to MSMEs to meet the requirements,” he said adding that MSMEs will benefit due to two reasons. QCOs stop substandard goods imported at strange rates from outside the country and thus helps the MSME sector by protecting it from unfair competition. And secondly, when MSMEs meet the standards, they can become competitive both nationally and internationally and become profitable.

He called for the Trade Negotiating Committee and the business community to consider a preferential trade agreement to begin with to foster intra-regional trade and investment and enhance regional competitiveness.

There’s a long way to go before we can achieve its full potential, he said. The Union Minister called for deeper integration amongst the member nations to provide honest feedback and help strengthen trade facilitation and cross-border movement of goods. He further said that there should be a focus on reducing trade deficit, strengthening of trade facilitation measures to strengthen partnership in e-commerce, digital public infrastructure and better integration of custom borders with the aid of technology. The Minister noted that there is a need for computerisation of border controls, faster clearances of the import-export online application processes which will help in Ease of Doing Business. The Minister said that there should be a focus on strengthening supply chains, removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers, strengthening of trade facilitation measures by adopting international norms and seamless transport connectivity, essential to unleashing the full potential of trade and investment cooperation among the BIMSTEC Member States. Shri Goyal expressed hope in greater integration of startups and entrepreneurs of the seven member countries to provide assistance in investment, trade and tourism. He also urged the member nations need to encourage technology and foster agricultural cooperation to secure food security, healthcare and human resource development among each other. On Blue Economy, the Union Minister said the member states have a thriving blue economy or demand of ocean products enhancing livelihoods and job creation while preserving marine and coastal ecosystems.

The Department of Telecommunications (DoT), through its letter dated 08.12.2022, requested the Authority to provide recommendations, under Section 11(1)(a) of TRAI Act, 1997 (as amended), on ‘Open and De-licensed use of Unused or Limited used Spectrum Bands for Demand Generation for Limited period in Tera Hertz Range’. In this regard, the Authority issued a consultation paper on Open and De-licensed use of Unused or Limited Used Spectrum Bands for Demand Generation for Limited Period in Tera Hertz Range on 27.09.2023 for seeking comments and counter-comments of stakeholders. In response, 17 stakeholders furnished comments, and two stakeholders furnished their counter comments. An Open House Discussion on the consultation paper was held through virtual mode on 08.03.2024. Based on the comments received from stakeholders in the consultation process, and on its own analysis, TRAI has finalized Recommendations on the Tera Hertz Spectrum. The salient features of the Recommendations are as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Tera Hertz Experimental Authorisation (THEA), recommended by the Authority, would encourage entrepreneurs and academia to develop innovative new technologies and services in the Tera Hertz band. THEA would help experimenters to evaluate the performance of products in the Tera Hertz band in the conception, development and design stages which would, in turn, pave a path to ascertain the technical viability of technologies and services built on the Tera Hertz spectrum. Upon implementation, the new experimental authorisation regime recommended by the Authority will provide a boost to the ‘Make in India’ initiatives of the Government. The Authority is of the view that permitting the authorisation and assignment-exempt use of the 116-123 GHz, 174.8-182 GHz, 185-190 GHz, and 244-246 GHz bands would support the introduction of next-generation wireless technologies that could be deployed both indoor and outdoor, operating over distances ranging from less than a meter to several hundred meters, and deliver increased capacity and reliability for existing use cases as well as new and emerging use cases. Releasing these bands would also support a variety of innovative use cases that will significantly enhance operations and growth in vertical industries. Vehicular radars can determine the distance and relative speed of objects in front of, besides, or behind a vehicle to improve the driver’s ability to perceive objects under poor visibility conditions or in blind spots. Long-range vehicular radars (LRRs) use up to 1 GHz of bandwidth and typically provide a spatial resolution of the order of 0.5 meters. The vehicular radar industry has also developed short-range vehicular radar (SRR) applications that use up to 4 GHz of bandwidth, and typically provide a higher spatial resolution than LRRs, of the order of 0.1 meters. Internationally, SRR units operating in the 77 GHz to 81 GHz band are used for several applications to enhance the active and passive safety of road users. Applications which enhance passive safety include obstacle detection, collision warning, lane departure warning, lane change aid, blind spot detection, parking aid and airbag arming. The combination of these functions is referred to in the literature as a “safety belt” for cars. Keeping in view that the short-range vehicular radar (SRR) applications can significantly enhance the safety of drivers and other road users, the Authority has recommended to permit authorisation and assignment-exempt operations of the 77-81 GHz band for automotive radars in India. The Recommendations have been placed on the TRAI’s website (www.trai.gov.in).

These Regulations are applicable for Access (Fixed and Mobile) and Broadband services. The full text of the Regulations is available on TRAI’s website at www.trai.gov.in. TRAI had earlier issued three different regulations prescribing standards of Quality of Service (QoS), for Basic and Cellular Mobile Services, Broadband Services, and Broadband Wireless Services, namely (i) The Standards of Quality of Service of Basic Telephone Service (Wireline) and Cellular Mobile Telephone Service Regulations, 2009 (ii) Quality of Service of Broadband Service Regulations 2006 and (iii) The Standards of Quality of Service for Wireless Data Services Regulations 2012, amended from time to time. The new Regulations shall supersede above referred three regulations. The above three regulations were notified more than a decade ago. Since then, the technology landscape of telecom networks has completely changed and moved towards converged networks. To account for the quality aspects arising out of large-scale penetration of new & emerging technologies such as 4G & 5G and high-speed broadband services on fiber, the Authority decided to carry out an extensive review of the existing regulations and put forward a comprehensive regulatory framework which encompasses QoS benchmarks for all three services at one place. The QoS standards set will achieve the delivery of high-Quality Service to consumers. The revised regulations have been finalized after following a detailed consultative process through a Consultation Paper on ‘Review of Quality-of-Service Standards for Access Services (Wireless and Wireline) and Broadband (Wireless and Wireline) Services’ issued on 18th August 2023 inviting comments from the stakeholders. An Open House Discussion (OHD) was held with the stakeholders on 9th April 2024 where in representatives from stakeholders and consumer forums shared their views on different provisions of the Regulations.

The National Digital Communications Policy, 2018 under ‘Connect India’ mission had set the goal to enable deployment of 10 million public Wi-Fi hotspots by 2022 for creating a robust digital communication infrastructure. Further, the Bharat 6G Vision also sets the goal of 10 million public Wi-Fi hotspots by 2022 and 50 million by 2030 for Digital India 2030 mobile and broadband policy objectives. However, PM-Wani hotspot numbers presently are much below the targeted numbers, as envisaged in NDCP, 2018 document and in Bharat 6G vision document. In November 2022, Department of Telecommunications (DoT) in its communication to TRAI stated that the proliferation of the PM-WANI scheme is quite limited and far below the targets due to extremely high cost of backhaul internet connectivity charged by Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) from Public Data Offices (PDOs). Further, DoT has opined that in the name of commercial agreements, TSPs/ISPs often insist on PDOs to connect public Wi-Fi Access Points using expensive Internet Leased Lines (ILL) instead of regular Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) broadband connections. The Authority has analyzed this issue and is of the view that it is necessary to rationalize the cost of broadband connectivity to PDOs to pace up the proliferation of PM-WANI scheme. Accordingly, the Authority proposes that for the purpose of providing PM-WANI scheme, tariff for Public Data Office under PM-Wani scheme shall be same as is applicable for retail broadband (FTTH) connections. The draft Amendment Order has been placed on TRAI’s website (www.trai.gov.in).

With the establishment of a dedicated standardisation department, the Bureau has expedited standardisation activity in the domain. The new department focuses on promoting safety, efficacy, and quality of Ayush products and practices, encompassing traditional Indian systems of medicine such as Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa–Rigpa, and Homoeopathy. While explaining the process and structure of standardisation activity for Ayush, Sh. Pramod Kumar Tiwari, Director General, BIS, stated, “Under the leadership of renowned experts, the Ayush department at BIS has formed seven sectional committees, each addressing a specific Ayush system.

The decision was taken to protect & promote the rights of consumers as a class and ensure that no false or misleading advertisement is made of any goods or services which contravenes the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. In view of the violation of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the CCPA, headed by Chief Commissioner, Smt. Nidhi Khare, and Commissioner, Shri Anupam Mishra has issued an Order against Sriram’s IAS for misleading advertisement regarding UPSC Civil Service Exam 2022. Coaching Institutes and online edtech platforms use pictures and names of same successful candidates to influence prospective aspirants (consumers), without disclosing the courses opted by such candidates & length of the course so attended. Sriram’s IAS in its advertisement made the following claims-\\nCCPA found out that it Sriram’s IAS advertised various types of courses but the information with respect to the course opted by the advertised successful candidates in abovementioned UPSC Civil Service exams results was deliberately concealed in the advertisement. This has the effect of consumers falsely believing that all the successful candidates so claimed by the Institute had opted for the paid courses advertised by the Institute on its website. Section- 2(28) (iv) of Consumer Protection Act talks about misleading advertisement in relation to deliberately concealing important information. Information regarding the course opted by successful candidates is important for the consumers to know so that they can make informed choice while deciding which course and coaching institute to join. Sriram’s IAS in its response submitted the details of only 171 successful candidates against its claim of 200 plus selections in UPSC CSE 2022. Out of these 171 candidates, 102 were from Free Interview Guidance Programme (IGP), 55 were from Free Test Series, 9 were from GS Classroom course and 5 candidates were from different States under the MoU signed between the State Government and the Institute to provide free coaching. This fact was not disclosed in their advertisement, thereby deceiving consumers. It is a well-known fact that successful candidates of Civil Services Examination have to clear all the 3 stages of Exams. Viz., Prelims, Main Exams and Personality Test (PT). While Prelims is a screening test, the marks obtained in both Mains Exams and Personality Test are counted for getting finally selected. The total marks for Main Exams and PT are 1750 and 275 respectively. Thus contribution of Personality Test is 13.5% in the total marks. Majority of candidates had already cleared Preliminary and Mains examination by himself/herself, with no contribution of Sriram’s IAS. By concealing this important fact, such false & misleading advertisement creates huge impact on those consumers who are UPSC aspirants without letting them know that Sriram’s IAS had offered guidance to only such successful candidates who had already cleared Preliminary and Mains examination of UPSC examination. Thus, the advertisement has violated the consumer’s right to be informed so as to protect himself against unfair trade practice. Smt. Nidhi Khare, Chief Commissioner of CCPA, emphasized that an advertisement shall contain truthful & honest representation of facts by disclosing important information in such a manner that they are clear, prominent and extremely hard to miss for consumers. She highlighted the importance of consumer rights and the obligation of advertisers to provide accurate information to consumers. ****\\nAD/NS\\n'),\n",

Already 22 commodities were being covered under monitoring of daily prices. Now, price of total 38 commodities will be monitored. The Department has been monitoring the daily prices from 550 centres across 34 States/UTs. The price data monitored by the Department provides advance inputs for policy decision for the Government, RBI and analysts regarding the CPI inflation. The 38 commodities constitutes close to 31% of the total CPI weights as against 26.5% of CPI weights captured by the 22 commodities. The newly added 16 items included are Bajra, Jowar, Ragi, Suji (wheat), Maida (wheat), Besan, Ghee, Butter, Brinjal, Egg, Black Pepper, Coriander, Cummin seed, Red chillies, Turmeric powder and Banana. The increase in coverage of food items under daily price monitoring will play a crucial role in policy interventions to stabilise price volatility in food items and to control the overall inflation. This initiative further reflects the Government’s commitment to addressing the issues of availability and affordability of essential commodities to the consumers. Government of India has, in recent past, taken series of measures to contain food price inflation. These includes providing Bharat Chana Dal at Rs.60 per kg; Bharat Atta at Rs.27.50 per kg and Bharat Rice at Rs.29 per kg to the retail consumers. NCCF has started retail sale of Tomatoes to retail consumers at Rs.60 per kg from 29th July, 2024. To prevent hoarding, stock limits are imposed on Tur and Desi Chana from 21st June 2024 till 30th September 2024. Import of pulses including Tur, Urad, Masur, Yellow Peas and desi Chana at zero duty has been allowed to augment domestic supply. Buffer stock of 5 LMT is being built to for release during the lean months to ensure availability and affordability. Price control measures taken by the Central Government together with robust progress in sown area under Kharif pulses this year (2024-25) have stabilised the market and the prices of Chana, Tur and Urad in major mandis had declined by up to 4% in past one month. The declining trend in mandi prices are now reflected in retail prices in recent weeks as the all-India average retail prices of pulses have declined on week-on-week basis. ****\\nAD/NS\\n'),\n",

The decision has been taken to reduce the huge surplus of stocks prior to the commencement of the new procurement season. Under the OMSS (D), the Department of Food and Public Distribution, Government of India, will directly offload grain to states for Rs 2,800 per quintal (excluding the cost of transportation). Shri Joshi added that if the States/UTs want to procure more than the stipulated 5 kg of free grain per individual, then they can procure that at the same price at Rs 2,800 per quintal instead of earlier Rs 2,900 per quintal. He also asserted that the sale of atta and rice under the ‘Bharat’ brand which was slated to run till June 30th, 2024 will continue. Speaking on the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY), the Union Minister said that Centre has decided to continue to provide free food grains to about 81.35 crore beneficiaries (i.e. Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) households and Priority Households (PHH) beneficiaries) under the PMGKAY for a period of five years with effect from January 1st, 2024 with an estimated financial outlay of Rs. 11.80 lakh crore totally to be borne by Central Government. “It is the biggest ever and the largest food security programme\" said Shri Joshi. The food grain distributed in 2023-2024 is 497 LMT and up to June 2024, the Centre has distributed 125 LMT. To address anaemia and nutrition-deficiency in the country, the Union Minister said that under the PMGKAY Scheme the Government has successfully completed all three phases and Custom-milled rice has been replaced with fortified rice in every scheme of the Government and 100% coverage of distribution of fortified rice has been achieved by March, 2024. “Quality food and nutritious food is the top priority of PM Modi government”, he said. On the high food inflation, the Union Minister said that tomato and other vegetables are seasonal. “Tomato price is stabilising and have made subsidised tomato available for Rs 60 kg without the use of PSF”, he said. On pulses, the Shri Joshi said that the sowing area has increased and there will be 100% procurement of pulses from the farmers. Shri Joshi also informed that ethanol production capacity has increased to 1589 crore litres per annum, till date which is sufficient to meet domestic ethanol requirement of the country. With payment of about ₹ 1.05 lakh crores, more than 94.8% cane dues for the current sugar season have been cleared taking cane dues to the lowest level, he said. He also added that in the interest of farmers, about 99.9% of cane dues of 2021-22 sugar seasons have been cleared. For the previous sugar season 2022-23, against cane dues payable of Rs. 1,14,494 crores, about ₹ 1,14,235 crores have been paid & only Rs. 259 crore dues are to be paid. Thus, about 99.8% cane dues have been paid to farmers, Shri Joshi said. On One Nation One Ration Card, Shri Joshi noted that Rs 145 crore portability transactions have been carried out nationwide till date. A total of 293 LMT of food grains to the NFSA beneficiaries either inter-state or intra-state have been carried out. ***\\nAD/NS/AM\\n'),\n",

Besides, NCDC has selected 910 primary fisheries cooperatives for development as Fish Farmer Producer Organizations (FPPOs) in the coastal states of India namely, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Goa, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Odisha and registered 70 new FFPOs in cooperative sector. NCDC has also provided financial assistance to the Government of Maharashtra and cooperative in Gujarat for purchase of 44 deep sea trawlers. The above steps would provide small and marginal farmers, including marginal fishermen engaged in fish production, with requisite forward and backward linkages, skill development, processing & cold chain infrastructure facilities, thus enabling them to increase their incomes. By availing the benefits under the schemes identified for convergence, marginal fisherman will be able to modernize/upgrade and setup various fisheries and aquaculture related infrastructural facilities which would help them in improving their productivity.

This would help in enhancing the income of cooperative societies and its members who are mostly from rural and farming communities. Cooperative societies were required to pay Alternate Minimum Tax at the rate of 18.5%. However, companies paid the same at the rate of 15%. To provide a level playing field between co-operative societies and companies, the rate for the cooperative societies have also been reduced to 15% for cooperative societies. Section 269ST restricts cash receipts in excess of ₹ 2 lakh from (a) any person in a day; or (b) from any transaction; or (c) from multiple transactions in respect of single event or occasion. In case of violation of this provision, penalty for the amount in contravention of section 269ST is levied under Income Tax Act 1961. For payment of milk price to their members, Milk Cooperative Societies receive cash, in excess of ₹ 2 lakh across multiple days in a year, particularly on the bank holidays, from a distributor, with whom they have contract. Resultantly, huge penalties were levied on the Milk Societies by Income Tax Department by treating contract between Cooperative Societies with its distributor as one event / occasion. CBDT vide Circular No 25/2022 dated 30.12.2022 issued clarification that in respect of cooperative societies, a dealership / distributionship contract by itself may not constitute an event or occasion for purpose of clause (c) of the section 269 ST. Receipt related to such a dealership / distributionship contract by the cooperative society on any day in a previous year, which is with in prescribed limit may not be aggregated across multiple days for that previous year. This would enable Cooperative Societies to make payments to their members, who are mostly from rural and farming communities, on bank holidays without fear of income tax penalty. The new co-operatives that have commenced manufacturing activities till 31.03.2024 shall get the benefit of a lower tax rate of 15 %, as is available to new manufacturing companies. As per Section 269SS of the Income Tax Act, 1961, any deposit or loan of more than ₹ 20,000 in cash is not allowed. Violation can invite a penalty equal to the loan or deposit amount. Section 269SS of the Income Tax Act has been amended to provide that where a deposit is accepted by a Primary Agricultural Credit Society (PACS) or a Primary Co- operative Agricultural and Rural Development Bank (PCARDB) from its member or a loan is taken from a PACS or a PCARDB by its member in cash, no penal consequence would arise, if the amount of such loan or deposit including their outstanding balance is less than ₹2 lakh. Earlier this limit was ₹ 20,000 per member. As per Section 269T of the Income Tax Act, repayment of the loan or deposit of ₹ 20,000 or more in cash is not allowed. Violation can invite a penalty equal to the loan or deposit amount. Section 269T of the Income Tax Act has been amended to provide that where a deposit is repaid by a PACS or a PCARDB to its member or such loan is repaid to a PACS or a PCARDB by its member in cash, no penal consequence shall arise, if the amount of such loan or deposit including their outstanding balance is less than ₹2 lakh. Earlier this limit was ₹ 20,000 per member. Government has increased the cash withdrawal limit of cooperative societies without deduction of tax at source from Rs.1 crore to Rs.3 crore per year. This provision will save Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) for cooperative societies, which will enhance their liquidity. Through Finance Act 2015, Section 36(1)(xvii) was inserted in Income Tax Act 1961 to provide for deduction on account of the amount of expenditure incurred by a cooperative society engaged in the business of manufacture of sugar. The clause took effect from 01.04.2016 i.e., assessment year 2016-17. However, the issue of treatment of additional payment for sugarcane price by Cooperative Sugar Mills (CSMs) as an income distribution to farmer members and resultant tax liabilities remained uncovered which was clarified by Central Board of Direct Taxes vide Circular No 18/2021 dated 25.10.2021. Accordingly, resultant tax liabilities on CSMs on additional payment for sugarcane price by them were mitigated w.e.f. 1.4.2016. An opportunity has been provided to sugar co-operatives to claim payments made to sugarcane farmers for the period prior to assessment year 2016-17 as expenditure. Accordingly, section 155 of the IT Act has also been amended to insert a new sub-section\\n(19) vide Finance Act, 2023, w.e.f. 1st April 2023. In order to standardize the manner of filing application to the Jurisdictional Assessing Officer under sub-section (19) of section 155 of the Act and its disposal by the Jurisdictional Assessing Officer under the said section, CBDT vide Circular No. 14 of 2023 dated 27.07.2023 has issued Standard Operating Procedure for making application by the concerned Cooperative Sugar Mills. This has resolved the income tax issues in this matter pending for decades. A cumulative benefit of approximately Rs. 43,407 crores has been extended to cooperative sugar mills and sugarcane growers collectively. CBDT vide circular no. 13/2021 dated 26 July 2023 has authorized Chief Commissioners of Income-tax (CCsIT) / Directors General of Income-tax (DGsIT) to deal with applications of condonation of delay from cooperative societies, who were unable to avail the benefit of deduction available under section 80P of the IT Act on account of delay in furnishing the return of income within the due date under sub-section (1) of section 139 of the Act for various assessment years from AY 2018-19 to AY 2022-23 and the delay was caused due to circumstances beyond their control or due to delay in getting the accounts audited by statutory auditors appointed under the respective State Law.

In his address during the event, Shri Amit Shah said that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi had set a target to prepare the vast cultivable land of this country for organic farming. He said that today the movement for organic farming has reached an important stage. Shri Shah said that Cooperatives have an important role in Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's vision of making India the world's largest organic food producing country. Union Minister of Cooperation said that Prime Minister Modi had set the goal of doubling the income of farmers of the country and one of the two important points was to promote organic farming. Shri Shah said that today there is an awareness about organic products all over the world and there is a huge global market for the same. When we increase India's share by tapping this market, the share of our farmers in the profitable business of organic products and their income also increases. Shri Amit Shah said that the health of the citizens of the country is also linked with organic farming. He said that the chemicals that enter our body through the use of fertilizers cause many types of diseases. He added that this has also reduced the quality of the land, so much so, that in many states the land has started becoming as hard as cement, due to which the risk of floods has also increased. Shri Shah said that on the contrary, with organic farming, the groundwater level increases, water is saved, production increases and the health of the consumer improves as well. Despite all these benefits, organic farming was not duly promoted. Union Minister of Cooperation underlined that, earlier, there was no mechanism to check the quality of organic products and farmers did not get high prices. Also, there was hesitation in using these products. Shri Shah said that to solve this issue, the Modi government established the National Co-operative Organics Limited (NCOL). He said that Amul and NCOL together will establish a network of international level laboratories across the country which will examine both, organic land and products. He said that both these recognized institutions will provide reliable organic products to consumers as ‘Bharat’ and ‘Amul’ brands. Shri Amit Shah said that now with the formation of NCOL, within a few years, we will ensure that all the profits from organic products directly go to the bank accounts of the producing farmers. He stated that it is possible only in a cooperative set up. Shri Shah said that in another 2 -3 years, products of ‘Bharat’ brand will cover all types of vegetarian food. Union Minister of Cooperation said that the organic products of Bharat brand are reliable in terms of quality and organic property, and are inexpensive as the motive of cooperatives is not making money. He said all profits from the organic products is going to increase the income of farmers of the country. He added that all these objectives will be met through NCOL and soon ‘Bharat’ brand will become a trusted brand. Shri Amit Shah called upon farmers engaged in organic farming across the country to join with the NCOL. He said that all the organic rice, pulses and wheat produced by the farmers will be purchased by the government. He said that in a short time, NCOL will create a smooth mechanism to send the profits directly to the bank accounts of the farmers. He said that a similar experiment in the dairy sector is successfully taking place all over the country today and crores of farmers are getting the profit of their dairy products directly in their bank accounts through cooperatives. Union Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation urged the farmers of Uttarakhand to make their farms completely organic and encourage other fellow farmers towards natural farming. He said that farmers of Uttarakhand should make their fields completely organic and stop using fertilizers. Shri Amit Shah said that Prime Minister Modi has set a target of making India the world's largest producer of organic food. For this, the Modi government has also created a cooperative society for the export of farmers' products, i.e. the National Cooperative Export Limited (NCEL). Shri Shah said that NCEL will take the ‘Bharat’ brand, being developed by NCOL, to the global market. *****\\nRK/VV/PR/PS\\n\"),\n",

Due to these issues the number of UCBs declined about 400 in the last two decades, with a total of 1926 UCBs in the year 2004 to about 1500 in 2024. New licenses have not been issued since 2004 for the UCBs. To examine the issues an expert committee on Urban Cooperative Banks Chaired by Shri N S Vishwanathan was formed. The committee presented its report on July, 2021 and recommended for formation of strong apex entity for UCBs. After examining the various options, the RBI gave an in-principle approval to NAFCUB to set up an Umbrella Organization as a NBFC. The Umbrella Organization named National Urban Co-operative Finance and Development Corporation (NUCFDC) for urban co-operative banks has been established with the objective to accelerate the digitization of cooperative banks by leveraging collective strengths, fostering collaboration, promoting innovation, and ensuring that member banks are well-prepared to navigate the complexities of the digital era effectively. NUCFDC has the potential to significantly improve the urban cooperative banking sector; its effectiveness will depend on how well it addresses these challenges and implements its strategies. The success of NUCFDC will be closely watched by stakeholders in the cooperative banking sector and could serve as a model for similar initiatives in other areas. (b): NUCFDC will play the role of National level Umbrella organization (UO) for the UCB sector in India and undertake fund based and non-fund-based activities. The objective of setting up of UO is to enhance the operational efficiency of UCBs, particularly the smaller UCBs, through capacity building, providing state of the art IT support and a slew of fund based and non- fund based services. This is expected to help in the sector’s growth and also enhance public confidence. NUCFDC has already obtained registration from RBI on 8th February, 2024 after mobilizing paid up capital of Rs 117.95 crore. As per RBI approval, the UO shall act as Self-Regulatory Organization whose functions /activities shall be as prescribed by RBI. The UO may approach RBI for obtaining approval to undertake activities of Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) only after achieving paid up capital of Rs. 300 crore and complying with the regulatory guidelines applicable to SRO at that point of time. The NUCFDC has been prescribed to attain the paid-up capital within one year from the date of registration by RBI, i.eby February 7, 2025. The scope of the SRO role to be played by NUCFDC will be set out by RBI\\nThe Ministry of Cooperation has been actively involved in various initiatives aimed at strengthening Cooperative movement in the country.

The list of initiatives taken and progress made so far are as follows:\\nA. Making Primary Cooperatives economically vibrant and transparent\\n1. Model Bye-Laws for PACS making them multipurpose, multidimensional and transparent entities: Government, in consultation with all the stakeholders, including States/ UTs, National Level Federations, State Cooperative Banks (StCBs), District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs), etc., has prepared and circulated Model Byelaws for PACS to all the States/ UTs, which enable PACS to undertake more than 25 business activities, improve governance, transparency and accountability in their operations. Provisions have also been made to make the membership of PACS more inclusive and broad-based, giving adequate representation to women and Scheduled Castes/Schedules Tribes. So far, 32 States/ UTs have adopted Model Byelaws or their existing byelaws are in line with Model Byelaws. 2. Strengthening of PACS through Computerization: \\xa0In order to strengthen PACS, the project for Computerization of functional PACS with a total financial outlay of ₹2,516 Crore has been approved by the Government of India, which entails bringing all functional PACS in the Country onto a common ERP based national software, linking them with NABARD through StCBs and DCCBs. A total of 67,009 PACS from 30 States/ UTs have been sanctioned under the project. The hardware has been procured by 28 States/UTs. A total of 25,674 PACS have been onboarded on ERP Software and 15,207 PACS have gone live. 3. Establishing New Multipurpose PACS/ Dairy/ Fishery Cooperatives in uncovered Panchayats: The plan for establishing new multipurpose PACS or primary dairy/ fisheries cooperatives covering all the Panchayats/ villages in the next five years, with support of NABARD, NDDB, NFDB, NCDC and other National level Federations has been approved by the Government. As per the National Cooperative Database, a total of 6,844 new PACS, Dairy and Fishery cooperative societies have been registered across States/ UTs. 4.

Details of number of PACS sanctioned and GoI share released till date to States/UTs are enclosed as Annexure. The states which have already computerized their PACS may integrate with the project. As per the guidelines of the project, Rs. 50,000/- for each PACS which have already been computerized, will be reimbursed to States, subject to the condition that they integrate their software with the National PACS Software. Also, their hardware should meet the required specifications and the computerization of PACS should have been commissioned by the State on or after 01 February 2017 i.e. the date of budget announcement by Central Government for computerization of PACS. Government of India is implementing the Project for Computerization of functional PACS which entails bringing all the functional PACS onto an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) based common national software, linking them with NABARD through State Cooperative Banks (StCBs) and District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs). The ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) based common national software brings about efficiency in PACS performance through Common Accounting System (CAS) and Management Information System (MIS). Further, in order to increase the viability of PACS and diversify their business activities to make them vibrant economic entities at Panchayat level, Model Byelaws for PACS have been\\nprepared by the Government. These will enable PACS to diversify their business activities by undertaking more than 25 business activities, including dairy, fishery, floriculture, setting up godowns, procurement of foodgrains, fertilizers, seeds, LPG/CNG/Petrol/Diesel distributorship, short-term & long-term credit, custom hiring centers, common service centers, Fair Price Shops (FPS), community irrigation, Business Correspondent activities, etc. By adopting Model Byelaws, PACS would be able to serve as multi-service centers, catering to varied needs of member farmers in rural areas. They will help in improving the operational efficiency, transparency and accountability of PACS; providing agricultural credit and various non-credit services to the farmer members thus giving them additional sources of income. Now, PACS have been enabled to deliver more than 300 e-services being provided by CSCs, including banking, insurance, Aadhar enrolment/ updation, health services, legal services, etc. to rural citizens of the country. There are more than 13 Crore farmer members associated with about 1.05 lakh PACS.

The event marked a pivotal step towards cultivating leaders to drive sustainable and responsible business practices to benchmark the impact of leadership in India. Dr. Ajay Bhushan Prasad Pandey, Director General & CEO of IICA and Chairperson of NFRA, and former Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, Government of India, delivered the event’s Keynote Address. In his speech, he emphasized the significant milestones achieved by IICA in the realm of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) through capacity building of business stakeholders, highlighting its crucial role in shaping the future of our country. Dr. Pandey began his address by referencing the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by world leaders in 2015 at a historic UN Summit. He noted that this summit marked a global realization of the importance of sustainable development. He explained that businesses initially focused on profit, then on environmental responsibility, and eventually on corporate social responsibility. Today, the sustainability domain has emerged, encompassing all these aspects. He pointed out that the significance of ESG has grown rapidly over the past two decades due to the evolving global landscape. Businesses are now required to be more responsible for their impact on the environment and society to attract investors and various stakeholders. ESG has become key to the sustained growth of businesses, aligning perfectly with the 4Ps of the G20 New Delhi Declaration Landmark Document 2023: Planet, People, Peace, and Prosperity. Adopting ESG core principles in business operations helps identify cost-saving opportunities, lower energy consumption, reduce resource waste, and minimize operational costs. Dr. Pandey stressed the importance of mandatory ESG reporting practices to avoid reputational and compliance issues in the future.

He also provided insights into the evolving role of ESG regulations in India’s growth and development, motivating delegates from various public and private companies to integrate ESG principles into their core strategies to keep pace with global trends. At the end of his address, Dr. Pandey thanked HP and UNICEF for supporting the program and urged the delegates to become real impact leaders, contributing to the development of India and the world.

This three-day gathering aims to foster collaboration among State Museums and the Central Government in realizing the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi’s vision for the ‘Yuga Yugeen Bharat Museum’ that aims to exemplify global best practices. To foster a comprehensive understanding of India’s artefact wealth for the ‘Yuga Yugeen Bharat Museum’, the States have been invited to provide detailed insights into their respective State’s collections at the forthcoming State Conclave. Speaking on the occasion, the Union Minister said that this Conclave being attended by a diverse group of stakeholders, including Resident Commissioners, Directors of Museums, Superintendents, Curators, Professors and Researchers from across the country is the third phase in a series of capacity-building initiatives undertaken by the GLAM Division of the Ministry of Culture. The inter-ministerial consultations were held on 14th June, 2024 and the subsequent collaborative workshop with museum professionals-directors, curators, education officers and conservators was held in partnership with France Museums from 25th-29th June, 2024. Through these capacity-building workshops led by renowned Indian and international museum professionals, the ministry aims to equip state-level personnel with essential skills in collection management, archiving, and museum administration, stated the minister. The minister expressed hope that the 3-day State conclave will further strengthen the museum ecosystem in India and will offer hands-on training and opportunities for experience sharing with potential collaborators for the ‘Yuga Yugeen Bharat Museum’ (YYBM) project. With the spirit of cooperative federalism and whole of Government approach, the knowledge gleaned through these deliberations will be instrumental in shaping the development of the YYBM museum as ‘the wonder of the world’, in line with Bharat’s vision- ‘Vikas Bhi, Virasat Bhi’ the Minister added. To support state-level museum development initiatives, the Ministry of Culture will also present an overview of available funding schemes, including the recently updated Museum Grant Scheme and the Scheme for Promotion of Culture of Science, during the three-day Conclave. Yuga Yugeen Bharat Museum\\n\\nThe Yuga Yugeen Bharat Museum is set to come up at North and South Block as part of the Central Vista Redevelopment project that seeks to revamp India's central administrative area located near Raisina Hill, New Delhi. The museum will be spread over 1,54,000 sqm, making it the largest museum in the world. The video walk through for the museum was first unveiled by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi at the inauguration of the first International Museum Expo organized by the GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums) Division of the Ministry of Culture on 18.05.2023 and was reiterated during the inauguration of the Bharat Mandapam in July 2023. The Museum will be developed through Adaptive Reuse, in collaboration with France owing to their expertise in similar projects such as the Louvre, which too housed the French Ministry of Finance. The French are partners for this project owing to the long-standing friendship between the two countries, which had contributed to a Letter of Intent being signed between both governments in 2020 that emphasised Museum & Heritage Co-operation. ****\\nBeenaYadav\\n\"),\n",

The demonstration was carried out in front of the apex committee overseeing the DYSL-QT. This included submitting a quantum circuit from a cloud-based interface, the execution of the programme on the quantum hardware and updating the cloud interface with computed results. The project being executed at TIFR Mumbai’s Colaba campus is a three-way collaboration between DYSL-QT, TIFR and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). The DYSL-QT scientists put together the control and measurement apparatus using a combination of commercial off-the-shelf electronics and custom-programmed development boards. The qubits were designed and fabricated at TIFR and the quantum processor architecture is based on a novel ring-resonator design invented at TIFR. The cloud-based interface to the quantum hardware is developed by TCS. The scientists are now working on optimising various aspects of the system performance before it becomes ready for operation. Plans are underway to provide wider access to this system for education, research and eventually as a test bed for testing superconducting quantum devices for analysis. The next development target is to scale up the number of Qubits and assess the scaling trends with respect to technology challenges, development effort/time and monetary resources required for development, operations & commercialisation of various sizes of quantum computers.

A project designed to provide dedicated support and services to Defence Pensioners, Veterans and their families, Project NAMAN is centred around the implementation of the SPARSH (System for Pension Administration Raksha), digital pension system, which streamlines pension related processes for Defence Pensioners, addressing the critical need for accessible facilitation points for Veterans and Next of Kin (NOK) across the country. Speaking at the launch, General Upendra Dwivedi emphasised the importance of Project NAMAN in ensuring that the veterans and their families receive the care and support they deserve. He highlighted the project's role in extending these essential services to the entire resident population of military stations and surrounding localities. The project involves the establishment of reception and facilitation centres, enabled through a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Indian Army’s Directorate of Indian Army Veterans (Adjutant General's Branch), Common Service Centre (CSC) e-Governance India Limited, and HDFC Bank Limited signed last year in September 2023. These Common Service Centres (CSCs) are dedicated to Army Veterans, Pensioners, War Widows, and NOKs, offering SPARSH-enabled pension services, Government to Citizen (G2C) services, and Business to Consumer (B2C) services, all at a single, convenient location. In the first phase of Project NAMAN, 14 CSCs have been established at key locations across India, including New Delhi, Jalandhar, Leh, Dehradun, Lucknow, Jodhpur, Bengdubi, Gorakhpur, Jhansi, Secunderabad, Saugor, Guntur, Ahmedabad and Bangalore. The project is set to expand significantly, with plans to establish approximately 200 centres nationwide over the next 2-3 years. The banking partner, HDFC Bank, has provided the necessary IT infrastructure for operationalising the CSCs, while local military stations have contributed essential physical infrastructure and facilities. Project NAMAN was conceived after careful deliberation and feedback from the Defence community, reflecting the Indian Army's commitment to fostering camaraderie among serving and retired Armed Forces personnel. This initiative not only delivers essential care and support to esteemed veterans but also extends services to the entire resident population of military stations and surrounding localities. Each CSC is managed by a Village Level Entrepreneur (VLE), selected from among the veterans or NOKs by the respective Local Military Authorities (LMAs). These VLEs are onboarded by CSC e-Governance India Limited and receive comprehensive training to deliver the required services. HDFC Bank also supports the VLEs with a monthly monetary grant of ₹ 20,000 for the first 12 months, assisting in the stabilisation and sustainability of the centres. Project NAMAN stands as a testament to the Indian Army’s dedication to the welfare of its veterans and their families. By providing SPARSH centric facilitation, commonly required e-Governance services, and banking solutions at a single location, the project also creates entrepreneurial opportunities for Veterans and NOKs, empowering them to contribute meaningfully to their communities. ***\\nSC\\n\"),\n",

As a Major General, he commanded an Infantry Division in the Western Sector and as a Lieutenant General, he led a Corps in Kashmir Valley, where he played a crucial role in counter-terrorism operations. On September 1, 1996, General Padmanabhan took over as the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Northern Command and later, the Southern Command. He assumed the office of the Chief of Army Staff on October 1, 2000. Known affectionately as \"Paddy\" among his peers, General Padmanabhan\\'s legacy is marked by his commitment to the welfare of soldiers, modernisation of the Indian Army and strategic vision. He was also an Honorary ADC to the President of India. General Padmanabhan led the Indian Army during the crucial period of ‘Operation PARAKRAM’. He retired on December 31, 2002, after 43 years of exemplary service. His death is a great loss to the Nation and the Indian Army.

This was stated by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi during his address to the Nation from the ramparts of the iconic Red Fort in Delhi on the occasion of 78th\\xa0Independence Day on August 15, 2024. The Prime Minister pointed out that there was a time when the majority of the defence budget was used to procure weapons/equipment from abroad, but his Government focused on indigenous manufacturing to make the nation self-reliant. He lauded the Ministry of Defence and the Armed Forces for taking a series of decisions, including the notification of a number of positive indigenisation lists, wherein there are over 5,600 items that are being/will be procured only from the Indian industry after designated timelines. He expressed satisfaction that India, which was once completely dependent on import of defence equipment, is today exporting to numerous countries. It may be recalled that due to the persistent efforts of the Government, the annual defence production hit a record high of Rs 1.27 lakh crore in Financial Year (FY) 2023-24. In the same fiscal, defence exports touched a record high of Rs 21,083 crore, an increase of 32.5% over FY 2022-23. In addition, there has been a massive jump in defence exports in the first quarter of FY 2024-25. Rs 6,915 crore worth of defence equipment has been exported in the first quarter, an increase of 78% from the first quarter of FY 2023-24, when the figure was Rs 3,885 crore. Referring to the 2016 surgical strike & 2019 air strike, the Prime Minister, in his Independence Day address, stated that there was a time when the country was a victim of terror attacks; but today it is bold and strong, with the Armed Forces giving a befitting reply to anyone who tries to harm the sovereignty, unity and integrity of the country. He asserted that the nation is proud of its brave soldiers who selflessly serve the motherland. On the growing role of women in all the sectors, the Prime Minister emphasised the women are not just participating in the progress of the nation, but are playing a leadership role. “Be it the Army, Navy, Air Force or the space sector, we are witnessing the ever-growing Nari Shakti of our country,” he said. ***\\nABB/Savvy\\n'),\n",

Squadron Leader Deepak Kumar (32754) Flying Pilot is on the posted strength of AFS Hakimpet. 2. On 25 Aug 23, he was authorised to fly an instructional night sortie in a Kiran aircraft along with a trainee pilot. The sortie was being flown during dark night. While going around after a low overshoot, the aircraft experienced a bird hit resulting in engine flame out. At this stage of flight, the undercarriage had been retracted and was in the process of going up. He promptly assessed the situation and took a decision to force land the aircraft straight ahead. He simultaneously directed the flight cadet to lower the under carriage. Despite limited cues available in the night, he used his exceptional judgement and superlative flying skills to force land the aircraft on the runway. The available length of the runway after landing was just about 1000 feet, wherein his prompt actions of switching off, braking and engagement of arrester barrier resulted in safe stopping of aircraft, with minimum damage. These actions gain more credence considering the shorter than normal runway at Hakimpet, dark night conditions offering less cues to the pilot for force landing and in an extremely compressed time frame for reacting. 3. During this life-threatening situation, the officer displayed exceptional courage, perseverance and composure in recovering a gravely stricken aircraft. His undaunted courageous decision to force land the aircraft on a dark night required superlative piloting skills and exceptional situational awareness, thus ensuring the safety of a valuable national asset and precluding a probable loss of lives. 4.

Wing Commander Vernon Desmond Keane Vayu Sena Medal (31215) Flying Pilot is on the posted strength of a fighter squadron. 2. On 24 Jul 23, during a sortie on Jaguar fighter aircraft, he experienced an unprecedented Oil 1 and Oil 2 failure warning. The warning indicated a major Oil system malfunction warranting immediate shut down of both engines to prevent their imminent seizure. Such a situation had never occurred in the past and actions for such system failure have not been envisaged. The pilot while maintaining a calm composure, decided to shut down the left engine and initiated recovery using the right engine for the closest runway. While on approach, at an altitude of 2500 feet, the right engine failed catastrophically. The aircraft was now in a powerless glide, losing altitude rapidly and approaching densely populated Gorakhpur town. Since the only serviceable engine had also seized, the situation warranted an immediate ejection. The pilot while displaying superlative flying skills, controlled the aircraft, turned away to prevent loss of civilian life and property in case of a probable ejection and jettisoned empty fuel tanks clear of populated area. He simultaneously decided to attempt relight on the left engine and successfully revived it. He then deftly controlled and recovered the aircraft safely off a single engine. 3. During these multiple life-threatening situations, the officer displayed exceptional courage, perseverance and composure in recovering a gravely stricken aircraft. His undaunted courageous decision to remain with the stricken aircraft while displaying superlative piloting skills and exceptional situational awareness ensured the safety of a valuable national asset and precluded a probable loss of lives and property on ground. 4. For his act of exceptional gallantry and courage, Wing Commander Vernon Desmond Keane VM is awarded 'Shaurya Chakra'. ***\\nABB/JS/SM\\n\"),\n",

Wing Commander Akshay Arun Mahale (29451) Flying (Pilot) is on the posted strength of a fighter squadron. 2. On 26 Sep 23, he was authorised to fly a Low Level Aerobatics display sortie from front cockpit over a lake with populated area and high terrain in proximity. During the profile while positioning for a slow speed run at a height of 270 m AGL, with throttle selected to max dry power, the pilot experienced a loss of thrust with RPM stagnating at 83% and sudden rise in Turbine Gas Temperature (TGT) by 80-90° C which was way beyond the permissible limits. With only one engine available during this critical flight regime, the speed started to drop rapidly below 250 Kmph. At this stage, the ac started to lose height quickly with speed started dropping further, providing the pilot barely any time to recover the ac. Maintaining his calm composure in this grievous situation, the pilot turned away from populated area. He went against the natural instincts by descending and judiciously utilizing the meagre height available to accelerate the aircraft for engaging reheat on the serviceable engine to climb away. Had he not done so, it would have resulted in a catastrophic situation with uncontrollable yaw on the aircraft considering the critical regime of the flight. The aircraft gradually gained height and was recovered safely. In the extremely short span of time available, had there been any delay in the actions taken by the pilot or taken in any other sequence, it would have resulted in loss of life and a national asset. 3. During these life threatening circumstances, the pilot maintained his composure, displayed exemplary courage, leadership, presence of mind and thorough professionalism in recovering the aircraft safely. His superlative actions in handling such an unforeseen critical emergency with very little time and height available has resulted in averting the loss of a precious national asset and saved civilian life and property. 4. For the act of exceptional courage, Wing Commander Akshay Arun Mahale is awarded 'Vayu Sena Medal (Gallantry)'. ***\\nABB/JS/SM\\n\"),\n",

In his address, the Raksha Mantri termed him as one of the most revered leaders of the country, a titan of Indian politics, an able administrator, an advocate for social justice, and a cultural stalwart. Recalling the contribution of the former Tamil Nadu CM towards public good, the Raksha Mantri said: “While deeply rooted in Tamil identity, Thiru Karunanidhi never allowed regionalism to undermine the unity of the nation. He understood that the strength of Indian democracy lies in its ability to accommodate diverse voices and identities. His insistence on state rights was a call for a more balanced and equitable distribution of power within the Union. This commitment to federalism is a key aspect of Indianness. India’s diversity is its strength, and the federal structure allows this diversity to flourish within a unified framework.”\\nShri Rajnath Singh described Kalaignar Karunanidhi as a leader whose role in national governance and advocacy for democratic principles have left an indelible mark on Indian democracy. He added that the inclusive nature of Indian identity is reflected in Thiru Karunanidhi’s policies, which focussed on providing access to quality education for the marginalised and ensuring that women and children received the support they needed to thrive. “Kalaignar Karunanidhi was a fierce advocate for the rights of women and marginalised communities, pioneering reforms that promoted gender equality and empowered women. His government enacted legislation providing 33 percent reservation for women in local bodies, and he was instrumental in forming Women Self Help Groups. He also played a key role in creating welfare boards for workers in the unorganised sector, including agricultural labourers and transgender individuals. His work serves as a reminder that the true measure of a nation’s progress lies in how it treats its most vulnerable citizens,” the Raksha Mantri said. Describing Thiru Karunanidhi as an able administrator. Shri Rajnath Singh referred to his programme 'Manu Nidhi Thittam', wherein he had ordered the district officials to reserve one day every week only to listen to the problems of the people. “One of the most significant aspects of his tenure as Chief Minister was the focus on education and infrastructure development. His vision was not confined to Tamil Nadu alone. He recognised that the progress of any one state contributed to the progress of the nation as a whole. His work is a testament to the Indian spirit of self-reliance and progress. His legacy is a reminder that regional development is integral to national development. It best exemplifies the idea of cooperative federalism,” he added. The Raksha Mantri stressed that the Government, led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, believes in the power of democracy and cooperative federalism. India is not only fulfilling the aspirations of its 1.4 billion people, but it is also providing hope to people that democracy delivers development and empowers people, he said. Shri Rajnath Singh emphasised that the Government’s commitment for development is beyond partisan politics, terming the decision to establish Defence Industrial Corridors both in Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu as a case in point. “These corridors are aimed at boosting the domestic defence manufacturing sector and reducing dependence on imports. They are designed to attract investment, foster innovation, and create a robust ecosystem for defence production in India,” he said. He also highlighted the Kashi-Tamil Sangamam and Saurashtra-Tamil Samgamam initiatives aimed to celebrate the cultural integration of North and West India with South India. The Raksha Mantri also termed Kalaignar Karunanidhi as a prolific writer, poet, and playwright whose works enriched Tamil literature and cinema. “His efforts to promote the Tamil language and culture were rooted in his belief that preserving and celebrating one’s cultural identity is essential to the broader Indian identity,” he stated.

This remarkable accomplishment not only elevates the region’s traditional craftsmanship but also positions Eri Silk as a globally recognized, sustainable textile. Eri Silk is renowned as the world’s only vegan silk, where, unlike other silks, the moth inside the cocoon is not killed. Instead, the moth naturally exits the cocoon, leaving it behind for us to use. This ethical and eco-friendly process sets Eri Silk apart, making it a symbol of compassion and sustainability in the textile industry. The Oeko-Tex certification, a rigorous standard that ensures textiles are tested for harmful substances and produced in environment friendly conditions, is a significant endorsement for Eri Silk. This achievement further cements the silk's status as a Geographical Indication (GI) product of Assam, highlighting its authenticity and regional importance. This certification marks a pivotal step in bringing Eri Silk closer to penetrating the global export market, expanding its reach, and establishing a strong international presence. The recognition underscores NEHHDC’s commitment to promoting and preserving the rich cultural heritage of Assam while embracing sustainable practices. This milestone opens new doors for Eri Silk, positioning it as a leading eco-friendly fabric in the international market, and showcasing the region’s potential in contributing to the global textile industry.

IESO, established in 2003 at the International Geoscience Education Organization Council Meeting in Calgary, Canada, is an annual competition for secondary school students from across the globe. It aims to generate awareness of earth sciences through teamwork, collaboration, exchanging ideas, and competition. “The overall vision is to generate interest of the young in various fields of earth system sciences, with a focus on promoting awareness and solution-centric discussions around climate change, environmental challenges and natural disasters”, said Dr Jagvir Singh, Scientist G & Adviser, MoES. He was one of the Observers at the 17th IESO. India has participated in the IESO since 2007 and hosted its 10th edition in Mysore. This year, the 17th IESO witnessed teams from 35 countries, of which 32 made it to the finals. Competitions were across four categories: Theory and Practical, Earth Science Project, International Team Field Investigation, and Data Mining. To encourage the participation of Indian students (of grades 9 to 12), the MoES supports the Indian National Earth Science Olympiad (INESO) held in various schools across India. The INESO is a national-level prelude to the IESO, Facilitated annually by the Geological Society of India in collaboration with MoES and select educational bodies in the country. The topics for assessment for students include geology, meteorology, oceanography, and environmental sciences. Top-performing participants from INESO get to represent India at the IESO, which also receives support from the MoES. The MoES supports the INESO and IESO as part of the REACHOUT scheme under the PRITHVI (PRITHvi Vigyan) scheme approved by the Union Cabinet in January 2024. The scheme's goal is to improve understanding of Earth system sciences through research and development activities and to provide reliable services to the country. *****\\nKSY/PSM\\n\"),\n",

This energy has the potential of propagating up to hundreds of kilometres through sub-surface cracks and fractures associated with sub-surface lineaments that may have caused rumbling sounds with ground vibration in the areas as a natural phenomenon in the landslide-Prone zones.

This initiative aligns with the objectives of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and aims to expedite the attainment of full literacy across all States/UTs under the ULLAS - Nav Bharat Saaksharta Karyakram. This also supports the SDG 4.6 which is about ensuring that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women achieve literacy and numeracy by 2030. The Education Minister, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan while addressing the gathering on 06.02.2024 at the ULLAS Mela in New Delhi expressed that the ULLAS scheme lays the foundation for a Viksit Bharat and underscores the crucial role that literacy plays in realising this vision, as envisioned by Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi. The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 while talking of Adult Education, mentions in para 21.4:\\n'Strong and innovative government initiatives for adult education - in particular, to facilitate community involvement and the smooth and beneficial integration of technology - will be affected as soon as possible to expedite this all-important aim of achieving 100% literacy.' lt underscores the correlation between literacy rates and per capita GDP, highlighting the disadvantages faced by non-literate individuals in various aspects of life, such as financial transactions, job applications, comprehension of media and technology, understanding of rights, and participation in higher productivity sectors. In light of this, the Department has recognized the necessity of establishing a clear and inclusive definition of literacy that extends beyond basic reading and writing skills. Literacy will now be defined as, “the ability to read, write, and compute with comprehension, i.e., to identify, understand, interpret and create, along with critical life skills such as digital literacy, financial literacy, etc.” This approach ensures that individuals are equipped to fully engage in and contribute to society. The Department has also set a benchmark for what constitutes 100% or full literacy within the Indian context, “Achieving ninety five per cent literacy (95%) in a State/UT may be considered as equivalent to fully literate.” This enhanced definition was developed through a collaborative process involving experts from NCERT and UNESCO, among other experts. The consensus reached during a recent meeting, chaired by senior educational advisors, underscores the need for a literacy framework that meets global standards while being firmly rooted in India's unique socio-cultural landscape. The introduction of this definition marks a significant milestone in India's journey towards full literacy. It reinforces the Government's commitment to ensuring that every citizen has the opportunity to attain the foundational skills necessary for personal and societal advancement along with financial & digital literacy and critical life skills. The recent achievement of over 97% literacy in UT of Ladakh under the ULLAS scheme further demonstrates the effectiveness of these efforts and sets a benchmark for others to emulate. The Government of India calls upon all stakeholders to renew their efforts in promoting literacy and to work collaboratively towards the shared goal of achieving a fully literate nation. This initiative represents a critical step in fulfilling the vision outlined in the NEP 2020 and in ensuring that Bharat continues to make strides toward reaching full literacy by 2030 with ULLAS, making Jan Jan Saakshar. *******\\nSS/AK\\n\"),\n",

These guidelines aim at providing children of classes 6-8 an exposure to skill education using experiential learning pedagogy and to make learning at schools joyful and stress free. Under these guidelines, ‘Bagless Days’ are encouraged throughout the year for various types of activities involving arts, quizzes, sports, and skills; periodic exposure to activities outside school through visits to places/monuments of historical, cultural and tourist importance; meeting local artists and craftsmen and visits to other institutions / educational institutions in their village/Tehsil/District/State as decided by States and local communities and as mapped by local skilling needs. These guidelines are dynamic and are subject to periodic review based on feedback from concerned stakeholders and other developments.

Building on the success of the first cycle, this programme is designed to empower Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) with the skills and knowledge necessary to support students with specific learning disabilities. Secretary, Higher Education, Ministry for Education Shri K. Sanjay Murthy; Additional Secretary, Higher Education, Shri S.K. Barnwal; Joint Secretary, Higher Education, Smt. Rina Sonowal Kouli; Director, Higher Education, Shri Devendra Kumar Sharma; and Co-founder, Changeinkk Foundation, Smt. Noopur Jhunjhunwala graced the launch of the second cycle. The heads of Institutions and faculty from 45 identified centrally funded HEIs, such as CUs, IITs, IIITs, NITs, IISERs, CFTIs, SPAs, NITTTR, etc. joined through virtual mode. Shri K. Sanjay Murthy emphasized that National Education Policy 2020 inter-alia recognizes learning disabilities among a set of students, with a vision of equitable and inclusive education for all. It stipulates that it is essential that HEIs must be aware of students with specific disabilities, including learning disabilities, and should be sensitized towards addressing associated challenges. To overcome this issue, it is essential that a regular capacity programme on learning disabilities is conducted, he said. He also informed how a programme has been conceptualized to begin with the capacity building of key stakeholders with reference to specific learning disabilities among students, under the Malaviya Mission Teacher Training Programme. The first round of the 'Capacity Building Program on Specific Learning Disabilities' was conducted from January to July 2024 partnered with Changeinkk Foundation. In the first round, a cohort of 27 HEIs participated in the programme including Central Universities, IITs, IIITs, IIMs, IISERs, SPAs and NITs. As part of the programme, different sessions were conducted, viz., Orientation Session, Sensitization Session, Masterclasses, In-Person Zone-wise Workshop, and Monitoring of Implementation. More than 400 faculty members from different departments of these institutions were benefited. The second cycle of the programme that started today will run till December 2024 with sessions to be held both online and in-person with a new set of identified HEIs. It will focus on strategies and tools for identifying and assessing the students with SLD and addressing their needs. The focus of this programme will be on sensitizing the heads of the Institutions; the Heads of five departments along with the two nominees each from respective departments. Participants will engage in a series of interactive workshops, expert-led seminars, and practical sessions aimed at enhancing their ability to create inclusive learning environments. After successful completion, the same shall be replicated with a new set of HEIs over a cycle of six months. Shri S.K.

The workshop was presided over by Ms. A. Srija, Economic Adviser, DoSEL and attended by State Education Officers/State Nodal Officers (NMMSS) of States/UTs in hybrid mode. Officers from the DBT Mission, NIC-National Scholarship Portal (NSP) and UIDAI also attended the workshop. The workshop deliberated on areas related to the status of registration of fresh and renewal candidates on the NSP and also on the new feature of the One Time Registration (OTR) module added to the NSP from the year 2024-25. The OTR Module will be available to students across the year. OTR is a unique 14-digit number issued based on the Aadhaar/Enrolment ID (EID) and is applicable for the entire academic career of the student. The OTR is required to apply for the scholarship on the National Scholarship Portal. On successful completion of OTR, an OTR ID will be issued which will remain valid for the entire academic lifecycle of the student. On submission of an application, the System will generate an application ID against the OTR ID. The Portal will ensure that not more than one application ID remains active against an OTR ID at any given point in time. The students, on registering on NSP, will get an OTR and password with which they can apply for any scheme or withdraw from the scheme without getting multiple NSP IDs. The student’s whole history of scholarships/education can be tracked by the OTR. During the workshop, Ms. A. Srija spoke about the importance of timely scholarship payments to children of EWS selected on merit and the need for prompt verification of applications by state-level officers on the NSP. As the NSP hosts several State Scholarship Schemes also, the State/UT Nodal Officers (SNOs) were urged to provide orientation to the parents/teachers and students on the procedure for registering on the NSP through OTR for fresh and renewal cases. The SNOs were also asked to educate parents on registering the correct name and spelling of the child and their parent’s name and details in the school records as well as in the Aadhaar registry to avoid mismatch at a later stage on NSP. Further, Aadhaar has become mandatory from the Academic Year 2024-25. Shri Devendra Kumar, Director (DBT Mission), spoke about the features of the Aadhaar payment bridge introduced in the NSP since the project year 2023-24. The payment module in the NSP-NIC is activated after the sanity check is conducted. Under the NMMSS, DoSEL functions as an agency and disburses scholarships directly through DBT into the accounts of the beneficiaries. He also informed that the NSP has now introduced a Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM) and asked the State Nodal Officers to use the facility of grievance redressal. He sought State/UTs’ feedback and suggestions for improvement of the GRM. Ms.PriyaGopal, Scientist-E, NIC-NSP, made a presentation on the new developments in the portal during the year 2024-25 and the feature of OTR on NSP, which was followed by detailed interaction between SNOs and officers from the Ministry of Education, DBT, and NIC-NSP. Shri SanjeevYadav, Director (UIDAI), emphasized the use of bio-authentication instead of demographic authentication, which is a more accurate mode of authentication. He provided details on the application-based bio face authentication feature for students as well as Nodal Officers (SNO/INO/DNO) of NMMSS. It was informed that the scholarship amount is disbursed only to those accounts which are seeded by Aadhaar at the time of registration and that the beneficiary can check his/her Aadhaar seeding status from the NPCI and PFMS portals. During the discussion, he clarified doubts of the SNOs regarding Aadhaar seeding in NMMSS. Under the ‘National Means-cum-Merit Scholarship Scheme’ scholarships are awarded to meritorious students of EWS to arrest their dropout at class VIII and encourage them to continue their education up to the secondary stage. One lakh fresh scholarships are awarded to selected students from class IX every year and their continuation/renewal in classes X, XI & XII of the State Government, Government-aided and local body schools. The amount of the scholarship is Rs. 12000 per annum. The National Means-cum-Merit Scholarship Scheme (NMMSS) is boarded on the National Scholarship Portal (NSP) - a one-stop platform for scholarship schemes given to meritorious students of the EWS category. The amount is disbursed directly into the bank accounts of selected students by electronic transfer through the Public Financial Management System (PFMS) by Direct Benefit Transfer under this Central Sector Scheme. Students whose family income from all sources is not more than Rs. 3,50,000 per annum are eligible to avail the scholarships. The students must have a minimum of 55% marks or equivalent grade in the Class VII examination to appear in the selection test for the award of a scholarship (relaxable by 5% for SC/ST students). The exams are conducted by States/UTs every year for the selection of the students as fresh candidates. *****\\nSS/AK\\n'),\n",

With winters approaching, the Commission recognizes the urgent need to issue an Advisory to tackle the issue of uncontrolled burning of MSW including bio-mass (wood, twigs/ branches, dried leaves etc.) across Delhi-NCR, particularly during the winter months. The practice of open burning of bio-mass and MSW by security personnel and other individuals during winter season, often as a means to stay warm, expeditiously aggravates PM2.5 / PM10 levels in the ambient air besides other harmful gaseous pollutants and thus results in imposition of preventive/ restrictive actions under different stages of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in the entire NCR. The Commission, since its inception, has issued advisories, orders and directions towards mitigating the ill-effects of such uncontrolled open burning of waste/ biomass. Open burning of MSW and bio-mass etc., besides at other locations, is also witnessed across residential areas and is resorted to by the security staff / other service providers, particularly in gated residential complexes across Delhi during night times in the winters for heating/ warming purposes. The Commission’s latest Advisory to RWAs across NCR emphasizes the importance of providing sustainable alternatives such as electric heaters to mitigate the need for open burning, thereby reducing the emission of pollutants and contributing to cleaner, air for all. Further, RWAs and residents at large also need to be actively involved in fulfilling the collective responsibility to significantly improve upon the adverse air quality which is generally witnessed in Delhi during the winter months. In furtherance, the Directorate of Urban Local Bodies, GNCTD and the municipal bodies have also been advised to sensitise and widely disseminate this requirement amongst all the RWAs in Delhi and also monitor the implementation of the same periodically, under advice to the Commission. *****\\nMJPS/GS\\n'),\n",

As per the details available on PARIVESH Portal, more than 50, 000 clearances (EC, FC, WL and CRZ) have been granted so far. Ministry of Environment, forest and Climate Change has taken several measures through policy and technological interventions in order to remove redundancy and to streamline the clearance process without compromising on the rigor of environmental safeguards. Due to the above measures, the average time taken for grant of EC at the central level, from the date of submission of complete proposal, has reduced significantly to double digit in 2023-2024 as against the stipulated timeline of 105 days. Similarly, average time taken for grant of ‘in-principle’ FC approval has also been reduced to 150 days in 2023-24. The PARIVESH portal launched in August 2018 has met its objectives and facilitated uninterrupted services to the industries even during difficult period of CoVID. However, in order to enhance the Users experience, scope of existing PARIVESH has been expanded to ensure due diligence and adherence to environmental safeguards while examining project proposals by including new functionalities based on emerging technologies, such as GIS based Decision Support System (DSS), advance Data Analytics etc. Some of the transformational modules included in the expanded scope are: Know Your Approval (KYA) module which provides the tentative list of clearances required and to support the project proponent in accurately assessing the environmental sensitivity and planning of the project before its execution; Decision Support System (DSS) a spatial-based visualization and analytical module to provide tools for exploration of the project proximity and to help the expert committees and regulatory authority in taking a considered decision in expeditious manner taking all related environmental concerns into account; Common Application Form (CAF) and Application Form Management module to minimize the repetitive efforts of the Users and at the same time to ensure the single version of the truth across all applicable clearances and Compliance Management module to ensure reduction in compliance burden and improving ease of doing business. However, consideration of proposals for grant of EC is on the basis of EIA/EMP, examined by the duly constituted Expert Appraisal Committees (EACs) and final approval is given only after incorporating general and specific conditions so as to ensure compliances of environmental standards and safeguards.

In pursuance thereof, India formulated and submitted its Long-Term Low Greenhouse Gas Emission Development Strategies (LT-LEDS) to the UNFCCC in November 2022, which reaffirms the goal of reaching net-zero by 2070. India’s LT-LEDS is based on the principles of equity and climate justice and the principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities. India’s LT-LEDS involves seven key strategic transitions, namely: (i) Low carbon development of electricity systems consistent with development; (ii) Developing an integrated, efficient, inclusive low-carbon transport system; (iii) Promoting adaptation in urban design, energy and material-efficiency in buildings, and sustainable urbanisation; (iv) Promoting economy-wide decoupling of growth from emissions and development of an efficient, innovative low-emission industrial system; (v) CO2 removal and related engineering solutions; (vi) Enhancing Forest and vegetation cover consistent with socio-economic and ecological considerations; and (vii) Economic and financial aspects of low-carbon development and Long-Term Transition to Net-Zero by 2070. While granting prior approvals for diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes, under the Van (Sanrakshan Evam Samvardhan) Adhiniyam, 1980, the issue of forest fragmentation is duly considered. Mitigation measures are ensured and duly factored in while granting the approval for various projects particularly in proposals of linear infrastructure. Compensatory afforestation is a mandatory component for projects where diversion of forestland for non-forestry purposes is permitted which includes components of soil and moisture conservation and eco-restoration. Further, “Ek Ped Maa Ke Naam” tree plantation campaign has been launched throughout the country on the World Environment Day (5th June 2024). In addition, the Green Credit Program has been launched in 2023. The State Forest Department of every State and Union Territory have been requested to identify degraded forestland parcels under the control and management of Forest Departments which shall be made available for tree plantation for the purpose of generation of green credit. The National Afforestation Programme (NAP) is implemented on pan India basis, for afforestation in identified degraded forest areas with people’s participation and decentralized forest governance. Compensatory afforestation under CAMPA has also been used for taking up plantations on degraded forest lands and carrying out eco-restoration works. As per India’s LT-LEDS, mainstreaming adaptation measures in urban planning and measures for enhancing energy and resource efficiency within urban planning guidelines, policies and bye-laws is an important component of low carbon development pathway for the urban sector. The relevant policies and initiatives for sustainable urban planning include: (1) Urban and Regional Development Plans Formulation and Implementation (URDPFI) guidelines; (2) Town and Country Planning Act; (3) National Urban Missions such as the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT); Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (PMAY)– Housing for all (Urban), providing housing especially for low-and middle-income groups; Smart Cities Mission (SCM); Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM). The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) is implementing National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) as a national level strategy to reduce air pollution levels across the country. Under NCAP, City Specific Clean Air Action Plans for 131 non-attainment/million plus cities have been prepared to improve air quality. Funding for implementation of City Action Plans is mobilised through convergence of resources from various schemes of Central Government such as Swachh Bharat Mission SBM (Urban), Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), Smart City Mission, Sustainable Alternative towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT), Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME-II), Nagar Van Yojna, etc. and resources from State/UT Governments and its agencies such as Municipal Corporations, Urban Development Authorities and Industrial Development Authorities, etc. In addition, the Government has taken a number of initiatives for prevention, control and abatement of air pollution including enactment of environmental laws and associated regulations; notification of National Ambient Air Quality and effluent discharge standards; introduction of cleaner / alternate fuels (such as CNG/LPG); ethanol blending program; leapfrogging from Bharat Stage (BS) IV to BS VI fuel norms; revision of emission standards for industrial sectors from time to time, promotion of cleaner production processes; incentives for production and use of hybrid and electric vehicles; banning open burning of leaves, biomass and waste; and Constitution of the Commission on Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas. The Government has taken steps to protect, sustain, conserve and augment mangroves and coral reefs in the country through promotional as well as regulatory measures. MoEFCC has provided financial assistance to Coastal States/Union Territories (UTs) for enhancing climate resilience which includes conservation of mangroves and coral reefs, shelterbelt plantation, coral transplantation, enhancement of livelihood security of coastal communities, pollution abatement in coastal areas and capacity building. Moreover, Integrated Coastal Zone Management Plans (ICZMP) for identified stretches of Gujarat and Odisha have been prepared. Further, ICZM Plan and Marine Spatial Plan for identified stretches of West Bengal have also been prepared. MoEFCC launched ‘Mangrove Initiative for Shoreline Habitats & Tangible Incomes (MISHTI)’ in June 2023 to promote and conserve mangroves as unique, natural eco-system having very high biological productivity and carbon sequestration potential, besides working as a bio shield. MISHTI envisages restoration/reforestation of Mangroves covering approximately 540 km2, spreading across 9 Coastal states and 4 Union Territories. A total of ₹ 12.55 crores has been released to the states of Gujarat, West Bengal, Kerala and UT of Puducherry for restoration of 3,046 ha. of mangroves in financial year 2024-25. For enhancing climate resilience, regulatory measures are implemented through Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification (2011 & 2019) under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986; the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972; the Indian Forest Act, 1927; the Biological Diversity Act, 2002; and rules under these Acts as amended from time to time. The Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification, 2019, promulgated under Environment (Protection) Act 1986, has specific focus on conservation and management plans of 11 Ecologically Sensitive Areas (ESAs) including mangroves and coral reefs ecosystems.

These events include cyclonic storms, droughts, floods, lightning, thunderstorms, snowfall, cold waves, and heat waves. India Meteorological Department has analysed trends for precipitation and drought like conditions over India using ‘Standardised Precipitation Index’ (SPI). As per the analysis, extremely dry and severely dry conditions over parts of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, Sub Himalayan West Bengal, Sikkim, eastern Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir were observed in 2021. Further, as per a study by the National Remote Sensing Centre, the number of States affected by major floods increased from 08 States in 2017 to 15 in 2021. Analysis of trends in heavy rainfall and flooding indicate that their frequency is increasing in some parts of India, including the peninsular, east, northeast, and some parts of central India. As per the State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) of Manipur, the State is vulnerable to the water-induced disasters because of its location in the eastern Himalayan periphery, fragile geo-environmental setting and economic under-development. The valley areas witnessed frequent floods even after short spell of storm due to various reasons like manmade ecological changes in the catchment areas, the high intensity rainfall during the rainy season in the hilly areas. The flash floods affect agricultural lands and habitats, the urban settlement areas during rainy season. The damages due to flood comprise of breach of bunds, overflowing, landslides, erosion and depression of riverbanks at the vulnerable areas. State specific studies on the impacts of climate change indicate that crop yields would decrease decreased income from poor crop production, related food security and nutritional issues, increase in vector borne diseases and migration of population from rural to urban areas. The Government is implementing the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) which provides the overarching framework for climate actions, through national missions in specific areas of solar energy, enhanced energy efficiency, water, agriculture, Himalayan eco-system, sustainable habitat, green India, human health and strategic knowledge on climate change. These Missions are institutionalized and implemented by respective nodal Ministries and Departments. In line with the NAPCC, various States/Union Territories (UTs) have prepared respective SAPCC to address state-specific issues related to climate change. All SAPCCs call for mitigating disaster risk due to changes in extreme weather patterns, which include the development of Hazard Risk Vulnerability Assessment reports (HRVA), State Disaster Management Plans (SDMPs) and State Disaster Management Force (SDRF). Developing knowledge and capacities to monitor and forecast extreme events to inform disaster risk management and its reduction is a broad goal.

The air, water and soil quality of the surrounding region of the decommissioned / closed / discontinued mine is monitored and the mine owner is to ensure that the closure plan should include control of the pollution from the concerned mine. After the closure of the coal mine, the reclaimed land is leased out for various repurposing activities as per policy guidelines of Ministry of Coal. For decommissioning of Thermal Power Plants (TPPs), the project proponents are required to follow various rules and regulations, guidelines such as Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1976; Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981; Hazardous Waste Management Rules, 2016; Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 and E-waste Management Rules, 2022. The decision to decommission a TPP is taken by power generating companies based on their own techno-economic & commercial considerations and environmental reasons. The power generating companies or concerned State Governments generally take the decision on repurposing of the project land while decommissioning a TPP depending on the local requirements, future projects etc. taking into consideration the minimum environmental impacts of decommissioning and reusing the land for installation of a new TPP or any other project. In case the project proponent decides to go for installation of a new project, including a new TPP, necessary clearances and permissions shall be obtained as per the extant rules/regulations/notifications from the Competent Authorities. The Central Electricity Authority has issued an advisory to all the Thermal Power Utilities not to retire or repurpose their coal-based power stations (units having capacity of more than 200 MW) before 2030 and to ensure the availability of thermal units after carrying out Renovation and Modernization (R&M) activities, if required, considering the expected energy demand scenario and availability of capacity in future.

As per EIA notification, 2006, as amended from time to time, prior environmental clearance is required for all new projects and/or activities or modernization of existing projects or activities as listed in the schedule to the Notification, 2006. The process of prior Environmental Clearance involves examination of the project at different stages such as screening, scoping, public consultation and appraisal. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Report along with Environmental Management Plan (EMP) is prime requirement for the grant of environmental clearance for such projects. Several studies were conducted and their consequent mitigation measures were undertaken by the top statutory and non-statutory bodies like Zoological Survey of India (“ZSI”), Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History (“SACON”), the Wildlife Institute of India (“WII”), Indian Institute for Science (“IISc”). Independent organization with specialized skill such as IIT, NIOT, NCCR, NIO, etc. were also involved during the appraisal process. The evaluation conducted by ZSI has indicated that the project can be implemented with requisite environmental safeguards and appropriate conservation measures. A detailed scrutiny of the EIA/EMP report took place during the appraisal of the project by an independent Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) having experts from the field of science and engineering. The Environmental Clearance accorded contains as many as 42 specific conditions dealing with each component of the project, in addition to all standard conditions applicable to each component dealing with statutory compliances, air quality monitoring and preservation, water quality monitoring and preservation, noise monitoring and preservation, energy conservation measures, waste management, green belt, marine ecology, transport, human health environment and risk mitigation and disaster management. Further, three independent Monitoring Committees to oversee the implementation of Environmental Management Plan is also prescribed in the Environmental Clearance letter namely (i) Committee to oversee pollution related matters (ii) Committee to oversee biodiversity related matters (iii) Committee to oversee welfare and issues related to Shompen and Nicobarese.

Sand mining is regulated in terms of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 [MMDR Act] and the Mineral Concession Rules framed by the concerned State Governments / Union Territories (UT) Administrations under section 15 of this Act. Moreover, Section 23C of the MMDR Act, empowers the State Governments / U.T Administrations to make rules for preventing illegal mining, transportation and storage of minerals and for the purposes connected therewith and to also enforce the various provisions related to sustainable sand mining guidelines. The environmental damages caused by illegal sand mining includes riverbed degradation, loss of aquatic habitat, increased turbidity, water table depletion, soil erosion, flooding, damage to infrastructure, loss of fertile land, negative impact on local ecosystems decreased water quality and hazardous impact on ecological equilibrium of riverine regime. The legal sand mining has to comply with the prescribed extraction limits. The Legal Sand mining is granted Environmental Clearance by the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA), as per the prescribed provisions of Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification S.O. 1533(E) dated-14.09.2006 and its subsequent amendments on the basis of approved mining plan. Ministry has also issued the Sustainable Sand Mining Guidelines, 2016 and Enforcement and Monitoring Guidelines for Sand Mining 2020 to put in place an appropriate regulatory regime for sustainable sand mining and adoption of environmentally friendly management practices. The Environmental Clearance is granted together with prescribed general and specific conditions, including the volume of sand to be extracted and the depth up-to which sand mining can be done. The extraction limit is recommended by the State Level Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC) and approved by the SEIAA after scrutinizing the sand mining proposal on case-to-case basis, based on the nature of water flow, volume of flow, width of the river, replenishing capacity, degree of aggradation and degradation, existence of public infrastructure, etc. in compliance of the 'Sustainable Sand Mining Guidelines, 2016' and Enforcement & Monitoring Guidelines for Sand Mining (EMGSM), 2020' issued by the Ministry. Ministry, further, vide S.O. 3611(E) dated the 25th July 2018, has laid down the procedure for making District Survey Report for sand mining. As per the guidelines issued by Ministry, the District Survey Report shall form the basis for application for environmental clearance, preparation of reports and appraisal of projects. The Report shall be updated once every five years. Ministry has laid down the above procedures after much deliberation and indepth analysis and following the laid down procedure would encourage scientific, systematic and environmental friendly mining with respect to mining of minor minerals. The provision for aerial survey and use of remote sensing and GIS applications etc., are stipulated in “Sustainable Sand Mining Management Guidelines 2016” and “Enforcement and Monitoring Guidelines for Sand Mining” 2020. Further, Ministry of Mines, through Indian Bureau of Mines, has developed the Mining Surveillance System (MSS), in coordination with Bhaskaracharya Institute for Space Applications and Geo-informatics (BISAG), Gandhinagar and Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY), to use space technology for curbing illegal mining activity in the country.

However, Government has taken a number of steps to formalise the e-waste recycling sector of the country. The E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016 provides for compulsory authorisation of the dismantling and recycling units from the concerned State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/ Pollution Control Committees (PCCs). The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has issued guidelines/SOP for processing of e-waste. The CPCB and SPCBs have been monitoring the units and necessary steps have been taken to mainstream and modernise the recycling industry with the help of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. CPCB has issued directions under Section 18 (1) (b) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 from time to time to all SPCBs/PCCs for checking informal (non-formal) E-Waste activities, verification of authorized dismantlers/recyclers of E-waste. CPCB has time to time advised SPCBs/PCCs to carry out regular drives for checking e-waste processing in informal sector. Actions, such as, constitution of teams for carrying out drives, issuing of notices, closure of operation, seizing the e-waste against the informal processing are being taken by the respective SPCBs/PCCs. Ministry has comprehensively revised the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016 and notified the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2022 in November, 2022 and the same is in force since 1st April, 2023. These new rules intend to manage e-waste in an environmentally sound manner and put in place an improved Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) regime for e-waste recycling wherein all the manufacturer, producer, refurbisher and recycler are required to register on portal developed by CPCB. The new provisions would facilitate and channelize the informal sector to formal sector for doing business and ensure recycling of E-waste in environmentally sound manner. Provisions for environmental compensation and verification & audit have also been introduced. These rules also promote Circular Economy through EPR regime and scientific recycling/disposal of the e-waste. Under the E-Waste Management Rules, provision for reduction of hazardous substances in manufacturing of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (EEE) has been provided. It mandates that every producer of EEE and their components shall ensure that their products do not contain lead, mercury and other hazardous substances beyond the maximum prescribed concentration.

Even though India’s per capita GHG emission is minimal, India is committed to addressing the challenge with firm adherence to multilateralism keeping in mind the national circumstances and based on equity and the principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC), as enshrined in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Developed countries have to take lead in reducing their GHG emissions and by providing finance, technology and capacity building support to developing countries. India, at the 26th Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC in November 2021, announced its target to achieve net zero by 2070. In pursuance thereof, India formulated and submitted its Long-Term Low Greenhouse Gas Emission Development Strategies (LT-LEDS) to the UNFCCC in November 2022, which reaffirms the goal of reaching net-zero by 2070. India’s approach is based on the following four key considerations that underpin its long-term low-carbon development strategy:\\nIndia’s LT-LEDS involves seven key strategic transitions, namely: (i) Low carbon development of electricity systems consistent with development; (ii) Developing an integrated, efficient, inclusive low-carbon transport system; (iii) Promoting adaptation in urban design, energy and material-efficiency in buildings, and sustainable urbanisation; (iv) Promoting economy-wide decoupling of growth from emissions and development of an efficient, innovative low-emission industrial system; (v) CO2 removal and related engineering solutions; (vi) Enhancing Forest and vegetation cover consistent with socio-economic and ecological considerations; and (vii) Economic and financial aspects of low-carbon development and Long-Term Transition to Net-Zero by 2070. The economic, technical and political feasibility of Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) is highly uncertain. At present, retrofitting of existing thermal power generating units for CCUS implementation is not a viable option, until the technology is cost effective and less energy intensive. India requires considerable climate finance and technology transfer with effective international collaboration to implement CCUS on any significant scale. Transitioning to renewable energy generation is an important component of the LT-LEDS strategy. However, looking to the variability in generation of solar and wind power and its intermittent nature, round the clock energy storage system is also required. Pumped Storage Projects (PSP) and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are the major types of storage technologies available in the country. As per the Sixth Assessment Report of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),\\xa0 ‘carbon leakage’ occurs when mitigation measures implemented in one country/sector leads to increased emissions in other countries/sectors. Global commodity value chains and associated international transport are important mechanisms through which carbon leakage occurs. To address this issue, developed countries need to drastically reduce their consumption of resources and adopt climate friendly lifestyles. ‘Mission LiFE’ launched by India in 2022 seeks to channelise\\xa0 the efforts of individuals and communities into a global mass movement of positive behavioural change leading to change in demand and consequent change in policies to bring about paradigm shift from mindless and destructive consumption to mindful and deliberate utilisation of resources. It calls for a People’s movement involving the Government as well as the private sector and above all public at large. It is relevant to mention that India has revised its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDCs) by including, “to put forward and further propagate a healthy and sustainable way of living based on traditions and values of conservation and moderation, including through a mass movement for ‘LIFE’– ‘Lifestyle for Environment’ as a key to combating climate change” as one of the goals.

Nanjarayan Bird Sanctuary:\\nThe Nanjarayan lake a large shallow wetland situated along the north-eastern region of Uthukuli Taluk of Tiruppur District in Tamil Nadu. The wetlands in this region depend mainly on weather conditions, especially on heavy rain water flow from Nallar drainage. Nanjarayan Lake is located on the Tiruppur -Uthukkuli main road about 10 km north of Tiruppur city in an area of 125.865 Ha near Sarkar Periyapalayam village in Tiruppur district. The lake falls under two villages (Sarkar Periyapalayam and Neruperichal). The lake got its name from the fact that it was repaired and restored by King Nanjarayan who was ruling the region many centuries ago. Further, about 191 species of birds, 87 species of butterflies, 7 species of amphibians, 21 species of reptiles, 11 species of small mammals and 77 species of plants have been recorded in and around the lake. The site acts as feeding and nesting habitat for resident bird species, migratory birds use this lake as their feeding ground during the migratory season. The lake also serves as important water source for agricultural purpose in the region. The lake plays vital role in ground water recharge. The lake is announced as 17th bird sanctuary of state of Tamil Nadu owing to its rich avifaunal diversity. The local community has already formed strong association in protecting the lake and its habitat. The forest department in collaboration with the local community manages the lake on sustainable basis.

The Kazhuveli Bird Sanctuary covering an area of 5151.6 ha was declared as the 16th bird sanctuary in Tamil Nadu in the year 2021. It is a brackish shallow lake located on the Coromandel Coast in Villupuram district, North of Pondicherry. The lake is connected to the Bay of Bengal by the brackish Uppukalli creek and the Edayanthittu Estuary. Kazhuveli is one of the significant and biodiversity rich wetlands. The lake is one of the largest wetlands in peninsular India. The lake can be divided into three parts based on the water features viz., the estuarine part with brackish water, the Uppukali creek feeding the sea water and the Kazuveli basin with fresh water. The Kazhuveli Bird Sanctuary lies in the Central Asian Flyway and is an important stopover site for migratory species of birds and breeding ground for resident species of birds, breeding ground for fish and serves as a major recharge source for the aquifers. In areas of brackish water highly degraded mangrove patches containing Avicennia species are found. In the earlier years, this area was reportedly harbouring Tropical Dry Evergreen Forests.

The said provision, as it stands, came on the statute through the Finance Act, 2003 w.e.f. 1.6.2003. The Finance (No.2) Act, 2024 has made only an amendment in Section 230(1A) of the Act, vide which, reference of the Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015 (the ‘Black Money Act’) has been inserted in the said Section. This insertion has been made to also cover the liabilities under the Black Money Act in the same manner as the liabilities under the Income-tax Act,1961 and other Acts dealing with direct taxes for the purpose of Section 230(1A) of the Income-tax Act,1961. There appears to be a mis-information about the said amendment emanating from incorrect interpretation of the amendment. It is being erroneously reported that all Indian citizens must obtain income-tax clearance certificate (ITCC) before leaving the country. This position is factually incorrect. As per section 230 of the Act, every person is not required to obtain a tax clearance certificate. Only certain persons, in respect of whom circumstances exist which make it necessary to obtain a tax clearance certificate,are required to obtain the said certificate. This position has been in the statute since 2003 and remains unchanged even with the amendments vide Finance (No. 2) Act, 2024. In this context, the CBDT, vide its Instruction No. 1/2004, dated 05.02.2004, has specified that the tax clearance certificate under Section 230(1A) of the Act, may be required to be obtained by persons domiciled in India only in the following circumstances:\\nFurther, a person can be asked to obtain a tax clearance certificate only after recording the reasons for the same and after taking approval from the Principal Chief Commissioner of Income-tax or Chief Commissioner of Income-tax. In view thereof, it is reiterated that the ITCC under Section 230(1A) of the Act, is needed by residents domiciled in India, only in rare cases, such as (a) where a person is involved in serious financial irregularities or (b) where a tax demand of more than\\xa0 Rs. 10 lakh is pending which is not stayed by any authority. ****\\nNB/KMN\\n'),\n",

CBIC successfully concluded the Conference on a positive note with significant takeaways for relevant stakeholders and setting a clear path with a message that ‘Collaboration is the key for Trade Facilitation at the Indian Borders which are the First Villages of India’. The outcomes of the Conference are expected to significantly contribute to CBIC's ongoing efforts to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of LCSs, ensuring that India’s trade facilitation mechanisms meet global standards. CBIC remains committed to its mission of optimising the functioning of Land Customs Stations and facilitating seamless cross-border trade, which is vital for India's economic growth and international trade relations. These efforts align with the Government of India’s larger objectives under initiatives like 'Vikshit Bharat' and 'Atmanirbhar Bharat,' aiming to boost regional trade, strengthen cross-border relations, and enhance economic integration with neighboring countries. Land Customs Stations in India\\nThere are 122 Land Customs Stations (LCSs) notified under Customs Act, 1962, which are strategically located along India's borders for trade with 7 neighbouring countries i.e. Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Myanmar, Nepal and Pakistan, spread across 16 states of India. These LCSs facilitate the smooth movement of goods and people across international borders. Integrated Check Posts (ICPs) have been established at 12 key locations - Attari Road, Agartala, Petrapole, Jogbani, Raxaul, Moreh, Dera Baba Nank, Suterkandi, Srimantapur, Dawki, Rupaidhia and Sabroom, offering modern infrastructure and streamlined processes for efficient customs clearance. Additionally, 7 Border Haats have been set up at specific locations along the India-Bangladesh border to promote local trade by allowing local vendors to sell goods in designated areas, contributing to the economic upliftment of border communities. CBIC has actively engaged in bilateral and multilateral dialogues with partner countries to harmonize customs procedures, and creating a conducive environment for trade facilitation. Systemic reforms like National Single Window System (SWIFT), advanced risk management system, Post Clearance Audit, Authorized Economic Operator (AEO) programme, movement of cargo under Electronic Cargo Tracking System (ECTS), decongestion of land borders through promoting off-border clearances, among others have promoted ease of doing business at the Land Customs Stations. As per the National Time Release Study (NTRS) 2024 published by CBIC, there has been a significant 50 percent reduction in average release time in case of Integrated Check Posts in 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023.

PMJDY being the largest financial inclusion initiative in the world, the Ministry of Finance continuously endeavours to provide support to the marginalised and economically backward sections through its financial inclusion interventions. On this occasion, Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman, in a message, said, “Universal and affordable access to formal banking services is essential for achieving financial inclusion and empowerment. It integrates the poor into the economic mainstream and plays a crucial role in the development of marginalised communities.”\\n“By providing universal, affordable, and formal financial services — including bank accounts, small savings schemes, insurance, and credit — to the previously unbanked, PM Jan Dhan Yojana has transformed the banking and financial landscape of the country over the last decade,” the Union Finance Minister said. “The success of the initiative is reflected in 53 crore people having been brought into the formal banking system through the opening of Jan Dhan Accounts. These bank accounts have garnered a deposit balance of Rs. 2.3 lakh crore, and resulted in the issuance of over 36 crore free-of-cost RuPay cards, which also provide for a ₹2 lakh accident insurance cover. Notably, there are no account opening fees or maintenance charges and no requirement to maintain a minimum balance,” Smt. Sitharaman said. “It is heartening to note that 67% of the accounts have been opened in rural or semi-urban areas, and 55% of accounts have been opened by women,” the Union Finance Minister said. “The consent-based pipeline created through the linking of Jan Dhan-Mobile-Adhaar has been one of the most important pillars of the financial inclusion ecosystem. It has enabled swift, seamless and transparent transfer of Government welfare schemes to eligible beneficiaries and promoted digital payments,” Smt. Sitharaman said. In his message on the occasion, Union Minister of State for Finance Shri Pankaj Chaudhary, said, “PMJDY is not only a scheme, but a transformation movement that has enabled financial independence of many of the unbanked population and has instilled a sense of financial security.”\\n“The Prime Minister, in his 2021 Independence Day speech, announced that every household should have a bank account and every adult should have insurance and pension coverage. With the continuous efforts in this direction through various saturation drives carried out across the country, we have achieved near saturation in bank accounts and there has been continuous increase in insurance and pension coverage across the country,” Shri Chaudhary said. “With the support of all stake-holders, banks, insurance companies and state Governments, we are moving towards a more financially inclusive society and PMJDY would always be remembered as a game changer for financial inclusion in the country. Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana not only serves as an important example of Governance in Mission Mode but also demonstrates what a Government can achieve if it is committed to the welfare of the people,” Shri Chaudhary said. PMJDY provides one basic bank account for every unbanked adult. For this account there is no need to maintain any balance and also no charges are levied on this account. In the account, a free of cost RuPay Debit card with in-built accident insurance cover of Rs. 2 lakh is also provided to promote digital transactions. PMJDY account holders are also eligible for getting an overdraft of up to Rs. 10,000 to cover exigencies. The journey of PMJDY led interventions undertaken over last decade has in effect, produced both transformational as well as directional change thereby making the banks and financial institution ecosystem capable of delivering financial services to the last person of the society-the poorest of the poor. The PMJDY accounts have not only been instrumental in receiving Direct Benefit Transfers but also serve as a platform for hassle-free subsidies/payments made by government to the intended beneficiary without any middlemen, seamless transactions, and savings accumulation. Moreover, they have been crucial in providing life and accident insurance to millions of unorganized sector workers through Jan Suraksha schemes (micro insurance schemes). The Jan-Dhan Aadhaar and mobile (JAM) trinity, with PMJDY as one of its pillars, has proven to be a diversion-proof subsidy delivery mechanism. Through JAM, under Direct Benefit Transfer, the government has successfully transferred subsidies and social benefits directly into the bank accounts of the underprivileged. The successful implementation of PMJDY during the last 10 years has seen achieving many milestones. The major aspects and achievements of the PMJDY are presented below. As on 14th August 24 number of total PMJDY Accounts: 53.13 crore; 55.6% (29.56 crore) Jan-Dhan account holders are women and 66.6% (35.37 crore) Jan Dhan accounts are in rural and semi-urban areas\\n\\nTotal deposit balances under PMJDY Accounts stand at Rs. 2,31,236 crore. Deposits have increased about 15 times with increase in accounts 3.6 times (Aug’24 / Aug’15)\\n\\nAverage deposit per account is Rs. 4,352 as on 14.08.2024. Avg. Deposit per account has increased 4 times over August 15. Increase in average deposit is another indication of increased usage of accounts and inculcation of saving habit among account holders\\n\\n36.14 crore RuPay cards have been issued to PMJDY accountholders: Number of RuPay cards & their usage has increased over time. With the issue of over 36.06 crore RuPay debit cards under PMJDY, installation of 89.67 lakh PoS/mPoS machines and the introduction of mobile based payment systems like UPI, the total number of digital transactions have gone up from 2,338 crore in FY 18-19 to 16,443 crore in FY 23-24. The total number of UPI financial transactions have increased from 535 crore in FY 2018-19 to 13,113 crore in FY 2023-24. Similarly, total number of RuPay card transactions at PoS & e-commerce have increased from 67 crore in FY 2017-18 to 96.78 crore in FY 2023-24. PMJDY's success highlights its mission-mode approach, regulatory support, public-private partnerships, and the importance of digital public infrastructure like Aadhaar for biometric identification. PMJDY has enabled savings while providing credit access to those without a formal financial history. Account holders can now show saving patterns, which makes them eligible for loans from banks and financial institutions. The closest proxy is sanctions under Mudra loans, which rose at a compounded annual rate of 9.8%in five years from FY 2019 to FY 2024. This access to credit is transformative as it empowers individuals to grow their incomes. PMJDY being the world's largest financial inclusion scheme, with its transformative power and its digital innovations have revolutionised financial inclusion in India. ****\\nNB/KMN\\n\"),\n",

Singh Baghel, Minister of State for Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying and Secretary, DAHD, Smt. Alka Upadhya were also present in the meeting. In the meeting Action Plan for making India FMD-free by 2030 was discussed. It was informed that all assessment was made to create zones in country particularly in the States of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra & Gujarat on basis of sero-surveillance where vaccination is in advance stage can be taken up on priority for declaring as FMD-free zones. This will help in creating opportunities for export. Union Ministers informed that prevalence of animal diseases is a serious impediment to the growth of the livestock sector. Due to FMD alone, there are estimated economic losses of around Rs. 24,000 crores per year. Control and eradication of this disease would result in increased milk production, supporting livelihood of millions of farmers, increase their income, and increase exports of milk and livestock products as per international trade requirements. Government of India launched flagship scheme of NADCP for vaccination against two major diseases viz. FMD & Brucellosis. Under the programme 6-monthly vaccination is carried out in cattle and buffaloes against FMD and is commenced in sheep and goats. The vaccination against FMD in livestock in the country with 21 states had completed Round 4 and around 82 crore cumulative vaccination done till date. Round 5 is already completed in the States of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Under the flagship Programme, the target year to achieve eradication of FMD with vaccination, from the country is 2030. At this juncture, to safeguard and strengthen the benefits achieved with vaccination, coordinated efforts are required to be planned and implemented in areas like animal movement tracking, disease surveillance, biosecurity measures etc., along with the States concerned towards creating FMD free zones. To give impetus to the initiative, Union Ministers have extended support and guidance for necessary impetus to the concept of zoning to be implemented on ground. Discussions were held around the concept of zoning and the pre-requisites and requirements of achieving and maintaining the zones FMD-free. It was observed that not only it requires intensive micro-planning with the States concerned but a detailed roadmap for laying out the eventual objective of eradicating this disease by 2030 with vaccination. Union Minister observed that this mammoth exercise entails ensuring quality vaccine supply to the States. He also mentioned that it is a matter of pride that all the animal vaccines have been developed by ICAR Institutions and are being produced domestically. India now has capability to export vaccines to other selected Asian countries. The Department assists the State Governments technically and financially for accessories, remuneration to vaccinators, awareness creation and in establishing requisite cold chain infrastructure etc. The activities are monitored on a highly scientific manner with seromonitoring and serosurveillance for ensuring the efficacy and effectiveness of the FMD vaccination, which is the biggest drive, in livestock in the world. Under the directions of the Union Minister Shri Rajiv Ranjan Singh the decision of vaccination of pastoral sheep and goat against FMD was extended to all such population in the country. The vaccine supply has commenced and Ladakh has already started vaccinating the flocks. This is one of the 100-days action plan the Government has committed. The vaccination in the susceptible and pastoral flocks are closely & cautiously monitored as sheep and goats in many areas are also to be used as sentinel animals to establish the absence of circulating virus in the environment. Shri Singh made an appeal to participants to take this challenge of FMD-Free Bharat and asked all stakeholders including NGOs in Animal Husbandry Sector to contribute to the goal of FMD Free Bharat. He also highlighted important role of Information Technology in strict monitoring and supervision of vaccination in animals. ****\\nSS\\n'),\n",

The workshop, which was inaugurated by Dr Abhijit Mitra, the Animal Husbandry Commissioner (AHC), Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying, underscored the critical role that economic losses play as a key criterion in the process of disease prioritization. Dr Mitra emphasized that the economic impact of infectious diseases, particularly those affecting livestock, poultry, and wildlife, cannot be overlooked when determining which diseases should be prioritized for prevention and control efforts. Dr. Mitra pointed out that the financial burden associated with these diseases—ranging from reduced productivity to costs incurred through treatment and control measures—has a far-reaching consequence not only for the agricultural sector but also for the national economy as a whole. In addition to economic losses, the Animal Husbandry Commissioner advocated for the inclusion of biodiversity loss as a vital criterion in the disease prioritization process. He highlighted that the loss of biodiversity, which often results from the spread of infectious diseases among wildlife and other species, has long-term implications for ecosystems and the services they provide. By factoring in the impact on biodiversity, the prioritization process becomes more holistic, recognizing the interdependence between animal health, environmental sustainability, and human well-being. Dr Raj Kumar Singh, Epidemiology, AMR and Zoonoses Specialist, FAO India gave a detailed overview on the process of the Animal Infectious Disease Prioritization and the role of different committees involved in the process. The workshop brought together a diverse group of experts from DAHD. ICAR, State Veterinary Universities, State Animal Husbandry Departments, USAID, Jhpiego, \\xa0and the ECTAD Team of FAO India. The primary goal of the AIDP workshop is to comprehensively map, identify, and prioritize key animal infectious diseases. The process began with the mapping of significant animal infectious diseases, utilizing expert consultations and secondary research to assess their economic and disease impacts.'),\n",

This landmark event brought together 78 key stakeholders from the veterinary and animal health sectors, including representatives from ICAR Animal Science Institutes, Veterinary Universities, private sector organizations like INFAH, international bodies such as FAO, USAID, and Jhpiego, and DAHD. The primary goal was to collaboratively develop guidelines that will standardize veterinary practices across the country. Secretary, Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying Ms. Alka Upadhyaya graced the valedictory session on 9th August 2024. She highlighted the vital role of the animal husbandry sector in supporting livelihoods and ensuring food safety and security. The value of milk and milk products itself in India is more than 12 lakh crore. With the sector growing at a much faster rate compared to agriculture and other allied sectors, India faces frequent occurrences of both infectious and non-infectious diseases in its large livestock and poultry populations. If not managed effectively, these diseases can have significant and unpredictable negative impacts on community livelihoods. Given that only a few developing countries have Standard Veterinary Treatment Guidelines, the creation of SVTGs for India is a key initiative. This effort aims to establish a consistent treatment guideline for various diseases across the country. Ms. Upadhyaya commended the efforts of all experts involved in drafting the SVTGs and acknowledged the contributions of FAO and USAID in coordinating and conducting the workshop. She also praised the National Dairy Development Board's (NDDB) initiatives in developing ethno-veterinary practices for common livestock ailments and suggested their dissemination through the Accredited Agent for Health and Extension of Livestock Production (AHELP) trained by the Department. This approach will promote alternatives to antimicrobials, which is crucial for mitigating the risks associated with antimicrobial resistance. Animal Husbandry Commissioner, DAHD Dr. Abhijit Mitra inaugurated workshop on 8th August 2024. Dr. Mitra highlighted the initiatives taken by the Department for containment of AMR in India and this guideline will also be supporting to the National Action Plan on AMR. Deputy Director-General (Animal Science) of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) Dr. Raghavendra Bhatta emphasised the need for such an important guideline and also suggested that it must be a dynamic one and needs to be periodically updated. Mr. Takayuki Hagiwara, FAO Representative in India, highlighted the collaboration of FAO in different initiatives of Government of India. The workshop was coordinated by Dr Raj Kumar Singh, National Consultant, Epidemiology, AMR and Zoonosis, FAO India. The workshop's primary objective was to develop a comprehensive Standard Veterinary Treatment Guidelines document tailored specifically to India's needs. These guidelines aim to provide a robust framework for Animal Health Practitioners, ensuring consistency in prescription practices, reducing variability, and enhancing compliance among veterinarians and other prescribers. By establishing clear and standardized treatment protocols, the SVTGs will empower policymakers with effective tools to control and manage animal diseases more efficiently, ultimately contributing to broader public health goals. Another critical focus of the workshop was the promotion of Veterinary Drug Stewardship. The SVTGs include treatment guidelines for a total of 274 diseases covering 12 major species: Cattle, Buffalo, Sheep, Goat, Poultry, Pig, Horses, Donkey, Mule, Camel, Yak, and Mithun. These guidelines are designed to curb irrational and inconsistent treatment practices that have long plagued the animal health sector. By promoting the rational use of veterinary drugs, the SVTGs will play a vital role in reducing the risks associated with drug misuse, including the development of antimicrobial resistance, which poses a significant threat to both animal and human health. The outcomes of this workshop are expected to have a far-reaching and transformative impact on the veterinary sector in India. The development of SVTGs is anticipated to serve as a valuable resource for veterinary professionals, paraprofessionals, and animal health workers across the country. Additionally, the adoption of SVTGs is expected to lead to a reduction in antimicrobial and drug residues in animal-derived foods, thereby enhancing food safety. This workshop marks a significant milestone in the standardization of veterinary practices in India, aligning the country with global best practices and advancing the objectives of the One Health approach and the National Action Plan for Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR). The collaborative efforts of FAO, DAHD, ICAR, and other stakeholders in developing these guidelines reflect a shared commitment to improving animal health, safeguarding public health, and ensuring the safety of the food supply chain. ******\\nSS\\n\"),\n",

This historic achievement places India among an elite group of space faring nations, making India the fourth country to land on the Moon and the first to do so near the south pole of the Moon. This achievement is being celebrated across the country during July and August 2024, with the goal of engaging and inspiring the younger generation in the field of Space Science and Technology. Union Minister for Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying and Panchayati Raj Shri Rajiv Ranjan Singh will grace the event on “Celebration of National Space Day” at Krishi Bhawan, New Delhi tomorrow being organized by Department of Fisheries at 10 AM in august presence of Ministers of State for Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying and Panchayati Raj Prof. S. P Singh Baghel and Shri George Kurian, Secretary, Department of Fisheries Dr Abhilaskh Likhi and other dignitaries. To commemorate the remarkable success of the Chandrayaan-3 Mission, the Department of Fisheries is organizing series of seminars and demonstrations on “Application of Space Technologies in Fisheries Sector” in coastal States and UTs under the guidance of Dr. Abhilaskh Likhi. These seminars and demonstrations are being organized across 18 locations, covering topics such as Space Technology in Fisheries – An overview, the Communication & Navigation System for the marine domain, space-based observation and its impact on improving the fisheries sector. Department of Space, INCOIS, New Space India Ltd. and other stakeholders including Fishermen, Sagar Mitras, FFPOs, Fisheries Cooperatives, ICAR Fisheries Research Institutes, State/UT Fisheries Departments, Students from Fisheries Universities and colleges will participate in hybrid mode. The Indian fisheries sector plays a vital role in the Nation\\'s economy, playing an important role in providing sustenance, employment, and economic opportunities, especially in rural areas. With an extensive coastline stretching 8,118 km, a vast Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) covering 2.02 million square km, and abundant inland water resources, India showcases a rich and flourishing fisheries ecosystem. Space technologies can significantly enhance Indian marine fisheries management and development. Some of the technologies like Satellite Remote Sensing, Earth Observations, Satellite based Navigation System and GIS, Satellite Communication, Data Analytics and AI etc., brought transformative changes in the sector. Satellite Remote Sensing utilizes Satellites like Ocean-sat and INSAT to monitor ocean colour, chlorophyll content and sea surface temperature to identify the potential fishing grounds, and detect phytoplankton blooms, sediment, and pollutants for understanding the ocean health. Earth Observations leverage satellites like INSAT, Ocean-sat, SAR etc. to monitor ocean currents, waves and extreme weather hazards, for optimizing fishing operations and ensuring safety. Satellite based Navigation System and GIS utilises Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) enabled GNSS tracking for fishing vessels and GIS mapping for recognizing marine habitats, fishing grounds, and protected areas. Communication at sea could be possible with Satellites. Satellite based communication networks enables real-time data exchange between vessels, shore-based stations, and research institutions for improving Maritime domain awareness, safety and livelihood of Fishermen. Data Analytics and AI can predict fish distributions, detect anomalies, and optimize fisheries management using data from various sources. These advanced systems enhance efficiency and safety at sea through satellite monitoring which detects illegal activities, supports aqua mapping, and offers disaster warnings. Additionally, technologies like image sensing and aqua zoning offer precise tools for effective fisheries management. The Potential Fishing Zones (PFZ) advisories have brought remarkable changes in the marine fisheries sector. By fetching the ocean colour monitor data from the Ocean-sat satellite, potential shoals of fish aggregation are identified and disseminated to fishers. These PFZ advisories have significantly increased the estimated marine fisheries potential of India from 3.49 lakh tonnes in 2014 to 5.31 lakh tonnes in 2023. This has enabled fishers to locate and harvest better catches efficiently, reducing the time and effort spent at sea while also contributing to the sustainable management of marine resources. The Department of Fisheries, Government of India supports these technological advancements through the Monitoring, Control, and Surveillance (MCS) under the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY). This support includes the provision of communication and tracking devices such as Very High Frequency (VHF) radios, Distress Alert Transmitters (DATs), and transponders for the fishing vessels with services such as Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) enabled Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Automatic Identification System (AIS), and Potential Fishing Zones (PFZ) information. Furthermore, the Department of Fisheries, Government of India under PMMSY, has approved a project on National Rollout Plan for Vessel Communication and Support System in marine fishing vessels for Monitoring, Control and Surveillance. National Rollout Plan envisages installation of 1,00,000 transponders on marine fishing vessels, including mechanized and motorized vessels across 9 coastal states and 4 union territories with an outlay of Rs.364 Crores. *****\\nSS\\n'),\n",

The projects of today include inauguration and laying the foundation stone of 218 fisheries projects worth around Rs 1,560 crore. Shri Modi launched the national rollout of Vessel Communication and Support system at a cost of around Rs 360 crore. The Prime Minister also laid the foundation stone for important fishery infrastructure projects including development, upgradation and modernization of fishing harbours, fish landing centers and construction of fish markets. He handed out transponder sets and Kisan Credit Cards to fishermen beneficiaries. The Prime Minister emphasized that the fishermen community of India are the most important partner when it comes to ocean-related opportunities. Recalling his conversation with the beneficiaries of the PM Matsya Sampada scheme, the Prime Minister highlighted the transformation of the sector in the last 10 years owing to government schemes and its spirit of service. Informing that India is the second-largest fish-producing country in the world, the Prime Minister pointed out that in 2014, 80 lakh tonnes of fish were produced in the country compared to 170 lakh tonnes of fish today. “Fish production has doubled in just 10 years”, he exclaimed. He also stated India's growing seafood exports and gave the example of shrimp export worth more than Rs 40 thousand crore today compared to less than Rs 20 thousand crore ten years ago. “Shrimp export has also more than doubled today”, he added, crediting its success to the Blue Revolution Scheme which helped in creating lakhs of new employment opportunities. Throwing light on the government’s efforts to boost women's participation in the fisheries sector, the Prime Minister mentioned assisting thousands of women under PM Matsya Sampada Yojna. He spoke about advanced technologies and satellites and mentioned the launch of the Vessel Communication System today which will become a blessing for the fishermen community. Shri Modi declared that the government plans to install 1 lakh transponders on vessels used by fishermen to establish uninterrupted connectivity with their families, boat owners, fisheries department and coast guards. This, the Prime Minister said, will help fishermen communicate in times of emergency, cyclones or any untoward incidents through the help of satellites. “It is the government’s priority to save lives during any emergency”, he assured. The Prime Minister informed that more than 110 fishing ports and landing centers are being built for the safe return of fishermen's vessels. Giving examples of cold chain, processing facilities, loan schemes for boats and PM Matsya Sampada Yojana, the Prime Minister said that the government is paying more attention to the development of coastal villages while fishermen government organizations are also being strengthened. The Prime Minister stated that the present government has always worked for those belonging to the backward classes and gave opportunities to the deprived, whereas the policies formed by previous governments always held the fishermen and tribal community at the margins with not even a single department for the welfare of tribal communities in such large tribal-dominated areas in the country. “It is our government which created separate ministries for both fishermen and tribal communities. Today, the neglected tribal areas are availing benefits of PM JanMan Yojana and our tribal and fishermen communities are making a huge contribution towards the development of our country,” Shri Modi remarked. Union Minister for Fisheries, Animal Husbandry, and Dairying, Shri Rajeev Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh, first expressed gratitude to Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi at a program organized in Palghar, Maharashtra. He said that these schemes will provide employment to approximately 5 lakh 25 thousand people directly and indirectly. Shri Rajeev Ranjan said that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's vision is to become a developed India by 2047, and the Fisheries Department and Animal Husbandry Department are working with full determination to achieve that goal. The Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana has brought a revolution in the field of fish production. He said that fish production has doubled in the last 9 years. Until 2013-14, fish production was only 95.79 lakh tons. In 2022-23, fish production reached 175.45 lakh tons, which is double that of 2013-14. He said that under the leadership of the Prime Minister, fish exports have also increased. In 2013-14, exports were worth only Rs 30,213 crore, which has now increased to Rs 60,523 crore. Fish is exported to 123 countries in the world and the largest importer country is the United States of America, which is our biggest market. Union Minister Shri Rajeev Ranjan said that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has launched a developed transponder in the country today, which will be given free of cost to fishermen on board, which can be connected to any Android phone. He said that through this transponder system, fishermen will be connected to their families through 6 satellites and will be able to contact their families. Through this transponder, fishermen will be informed about which area of the sea has more fish available, so that fishermen and vessels do not have to wander far and can fish there, which will also increase their income. He said that through this transponder, fishermen will be informed about the dangers coming in the sea. They will also be warned before crossing the maritime border. The transponder system will bring a revolution in the entire fish production sector. Shri Rajiv Ranjan Singh said that the Prime Minister has also provided social and economic security to the people engaged in fish production. For social security, the Prime Minister has provided security through insurance. If any fisherman dies in an accident, he gets 5 lakh rupees, if injured, gets 2.5 lakh rupees, if someone is undergoing treatment in the hospital, gets assistance of 50 to 25 thousand rupees through insurance. Farmers and fishermen have been linked to the Kisan Credit Card. Today, through the Kisan Credit Card, fish production is increasing and in the coming time, production will be such that we will be able to export up to 1 lakh crore rupees worldwide. ******\\nSS/\\n\"),\n",

Changsan said that “Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has highlighted the importance of organ donation in his Mann Ki Baat programme and emphasized on the fact that one person donating organs after death can give a new lease of life to up to eight patients suffering from various organ failures.” She stressed on the need to promote organ donation from the deceased persons to meet the huge need for organ donation in the country. Underlining the government’s efforts for the cause, Ms. Changsan highlighted that “the Government of India has adopted a policy of \"One Nation, One Policy\" for organ donation and transplantation and has also started the consultation process with the State Governments in this regard. Our focus is to improve the availability of infrastructure and trained manpower for organ transplantation, especially in government institutions”. She added that the Government has already initiated an Organ Donation Public Awareness Campaign by the name of “Angdaan Jan Jagrukta Abhiyaan” which is actively underway in various states and institutions. Dr. Atul Goel, Director General Health Services (DGHS) said that “NOTTO has taken the lead in the field of organ and tissue transplant in India. The Chintan Shivir provides an opportunity for introspection to put systems in place”. He added that “In our nation we have had a tradition of giving i.e. altruism. While we have live donations, we need to encourage deceased donations as much as possible both in government and private hospitals”. The two-day Chintan Shivir will cover ten important themes concerning organ donation and transplantation and various sub-themes. The specific objectives for the Chintan Shivir are:\\nThe sessions will focus on themes such as plugging legal loopholes; One Nation, One Policy; ensuring transparency; improving the ecosystem, making organ transplants affordable, accessible, and equitable, and preparing a roadmap for the same. Representatives from States, NGOs, organ transplant societies, eminent transplant professionals, and experts from various government and private institutions will participate in the Chintan Shivir. Background:\\nGovernment of India is implementing the National Organ Transplant Program to promote organ donation from deceased persons so that more organs can be made available for organ transplantation for people suffering from the last stage of organ failure. Under this Programme, an apex-level organization “National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization” (NOTTO) has been established at Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi and a nationwide network of transplant and retrieval hospitals and tissue banks has been created. The registration of patients waiting for organs, transplant cases, organ donors, etc. is being done at the national level. The registration process has been made easier through NOTTO\\'s web portal www.notto.abdm.gov.in for people who want to donate organs after death. The web portal was launched on 17th September 2023. Additionally, five Regional Organ and Tissue Transplant Organizations (ROTTOs) have been established at Mumbai, Kolkata, Chandigarh, Chennai and Guwahati to reach out to Western, Eastern, Northern, Southern and North-Eastern regions of the country respectively. It is plannned to establish a State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (SOTTO) in every state and so far, 21 State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organizations (SOTTOs) have been established. Patients suffering from organ failure can register themselves to receive an organ from a deceased organ donor at the hospitals where they are undergoing treatment. A dedicated website www.notto.mohfw.gov.in provides information on organ donation and transplantation and facilitates online registration of hospitals for networking and creation of a national registry. Facility to take online and offline oaths for organ and tissue donation is available. A helpline is operational round the clock on the toll-free number 1800114770. ****\\nMV/AKS\\nHFW/Chintan Shivir on Organ Donation /30th August 2024/1\\n'),\n",

Recognising microplastic pollution as an emerging threat that requires immediate attention, the project - “Micro-and Nano-Plastics as Emerging Food Contaminants: Establishing Validated Methodologies and Understanding the Prevalence in Different Food Matrices” – was started in March this year to develop and validate analytical methods for detecting micro and nano-plastics in various food products, as well as assess their prevalence and exposure levels in India. The primary objectives of the project include developing standard protocols for micro/nano-plastic analysis, conducting intra- and inter-laboratory comparisons, and generating critical data on microplastic exposure levels among consumers. This study is being implemented in collaboration with leading research institutions across the country, including the CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (Lucknow), ICAR-Central Institute of Fisheries Technology (Kochi), and the Birla Institute of Technology and Science (Pilani). In a recent report, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) highlighted the presence of microplastics in common food items such as sugar and salt. While the report underscores the global prevalence of microplastics, it also emphasizes the need for more robust data to fully understand the implications for human health and safety, particularly in the Indian context. As the food safety regulator of the country, FSSAI is committed to ensuring that Indian consumers have access to safe and healthy food. While global studies have highlighted the presence of microplastics in various foods, it is imperative to generate reliable data specific to India. This project will help understand the extent of microplastic contamination in Indian food and guide the formulation of effective regulations and safety standards to protect public health. The findings from this project will not only inform regulatory actions but also contribute to the global understanding of microplastic contamination, making Indian research an integral part of the global effort to combat this environmental challenge. *****\\n\\nMV\\nHFW/FSSAI Launches Project to Address Microplastic Contamination in Indian Food/18th August2024/1\\n'),\n",

This landmark trial will evaluate the efficacy of India’s indigenous tetravalent dengue vaccine, DengiAll, developed by Panacea Biotec. The first participant in this trial was vaccinated today at Pandit Bhagwat Dayal Sharma Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS), Rohtak. Commenting on this milestone, Union Minister of Health & Family Welfare, Shri J.P. Nadda, said, “The initiation of this Phase 3 clinical trial for India's first indigenous dengue vaccine marks a critical advancement in our fight against dengue. It reflects our commitment to protecting our citizens from this pervasive disease and underscores India's capabilities in vaccine research and development. Through this collaboration between ICMR and Panacea Biotec, we are not only taking a step towards ensuring the health and well-being of our people but also reinforcing our vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat in the healthcare sector.”\\nCurrently, there is no antiviral treatment or licensed vaccine against dengue in India. The development of an effective vaccine is complex due to the need to achieve good efficacy for all four serotypes. In India, all four serotypes of Dengue virus are known to circulate or co-circulate in many regions. The tetravalent dengue vaccine strain (TV003/TV005), originally developed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), USA, has shown promising results in preclinical and clinical trials worldwide. Panacea Biotec, one of three Indian companies to receive the strain, is at the most advanced stage of development. The company has worked extensively on these strains to develop a full-fledged vaccine formulation and holds a process patent for this work. Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials of the Indian vaccine formulation were completed in 2018-19, yielding promising results. In collaboration with ICMR, Panacea Biotec will conduct the Phase 3 clinical trial across 19 sites in 18 States and Union Territories of India, involving more than 10,335 healthy adult participants. The trial, primarily funded by ICMR with partial support from Panacea Biotec, is set to follow up with participants for two years. This initiative represents a significant step towards developing an indigenous vaccine for one of India’s most pressing public health challenges and exemplifies the nation’s commitment to Atmanirbhar Bharat. Background:\\nDengue is a major public health concern in India, ranking among the top 30 countries with the highest incidence of the disease. The global incidence of dengue has been steadily increasing over the past two decades, with more than 129 countries reporting dengue viral disease by the end of 2023, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In India, approximately 75-80% of infections are asymptomatic, yet these individuals can still transmit the infection through the bite of Aedes mosquitoes. Among the 20-25% of cases where symptoms are clinically apparent, children are at a significantly higher risk of hospitalization and mortality. In adults, the disease can escalate into severe conditions like dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. The dengue virus has four serotypes, 1-4, with low cross-protection against each other, meaning individuals can experience repeated infections. *****\\nMV\\nHFW/Dengue Vaccine Phase 3 Trial/14August2024/1\\n\"),\n",

The initiatives include constitution of a National Task Force on AMR Containment in 2010 leading to development of the National Policy on AMR containment in 2011. The Government launched the National Programme on AMR Containment in 2013. Union Health Ministry has taken the following steps to\\xa0 combat Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR):\\nNational surveillance networks including laboratories from across the country have been established and are generating National AMR Surveillance reports annually and also submitting data to the Global AMR Surveillance System (GLASS). Awareness material on judicious use of antimicrobials and hand hygiene and infection prevention has been developed and shared with various stakeholders. National Guideline on Infection prevention has been launched and translated to training material. Training of trainers held for all States and UTs. Trainings are being further cascaded in States. To promote judicious use of Antimicrobials, surveillance of Antimicrobial use has been initiated at tertiary care hospitals. Ministry of Health & Family Welfare launched the National Action Plan on AMR (NAP-AMR) in 2017 which was developed in alignment with the Global Action Plan on AMR. The Action Plan is being implemented by various stakeholder Ministries. The duration of NAP AMR was for 5 years. Following National expert consultations were held towards development of NAP-AMR 2.0 in 2022:\\nThe consultations were held for the human health sector, research sector, professional associations and civil society organizations, environment and animal husbandry sectors. Each consultation was attended by experts who represented with the private sector, technical institutions, professional groups, industry, cooperatives, NGOs, International partners and other relevant organisations. Objectives of these consultations included undertaking SWOT (Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analyses across various sectors in context of the existing NAP-AMR and beyond as well as proposing the structure and contents of the proposed NAP 2.0. and to recommend essential elements of AMR research policy and research agenda of the country under NAP 2.0. Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (IDSP) is an important program under National Health Mission for disease surveillance in the country. IDSP is implemented in all 36 States/UTs. The program is responsible for the surveillance of 33 plus epidemic prone diseases. The surveillance tool consists of S (Syndromic) form filled by \\xa0Auxiliary Nurse and Midwife (ANMs) at the Sub-centre level, P (Presumptive) form filled by medical officers at health facility level and L (Laboratory confirmed) form filled by laboratories as per standard case definitions. Every State has designated laboratories like District Public Health Laboratories (DPHLs), State Referral Laboratories (SRLs) under IDSP for investigation and surveillance of these diseases. In the year 2021, to strengthen the disease surveillance in the country the programme has shifted from a paper-based, aggregate, weekly reporting to a paperless, case-based, near real-time reporting through Integrated Health Information Platform (IHIP) where all the 36 States/UTs are reporting. IHIP is an information platform that integrates data from various “registries” to provide near real-time information on health surveillance from all across India for decision-makers to take appropriate public health action. IHIP provides Geotagging of the individual cases reported in outbreaks for visual geospatial analysis, along with heat map. IDSP performs media scanning & verification of print and electronic media to strengthen the event-based surveillance. Artificial Intelligence is also used in Media Scanning and Verification to detect early warning signals and generate alerts for the timely management of potential outbreaks. The Government through the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has collaborated with various International Organizations/Countries to address AMR and enhance disease surveillance. The details of collaboration with International Organizations/Countries are attached at Annexure. NCDC is coordinating the National AMR surveillance network under which State Government medical college hospitals/laboratories are being strengthened for AMR surveillance and containment. Trainings are held round the year for AMR data management using the offline software WHONET. Capacity building is also done on specialized lab testing procedures. Trainings have been imparted to healthcare workers on Infection prevention and control. ANNEXURE\\n\\nThe India-US Centre for Disease (CDC) collaboration has focused on AMR surveillance activities, development of Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for AMR surveillance and data management, use of WHONET software, digital trainings using ECHO platform for standardization of bacteriology testing procedures across the network. CDC has also supported the ICMR-AIIMS project for HAI surveillance. Collaboration with United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is focused on strengthening AMR containment in 6 States. Under Indo-Netherlands collaboration, pilot project was conducted on integrated AMR surveillance with one health approach in Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh. UK's Fleming Fund phase 1 grant for which WHO India was the implementing partner has supported National Training of trainers on IPC and strengthening 3 State AMR surveillance networks in the country and Point prevalence survey on antibiotic use in tertiary care hospitals.

The event was also joined virtually by the representatives of State Medical Councils. Background: NMR will be a comprehensive dynamic database for all allopathic (MBBS) registered doctors in India. The uniqueness of the NMR is that it is linked with the Aadhaar ID of the doctors which ensures the individual’s authenticity. The whole process of registration in NMR is a very simple online process and all the medical colleges/institutions (including the Institutes of National Importance (INIs) etc.). SMCs are interlinked on the portal. Some data will be visible to the public and others will only be visible to the Ethics & Medical Registration Board (EMRB) in the National Medical Commission (NMC), State Medical Councils (SMCs), the National Board of Examinations (NBE) and Medical Institutions (including INIs, etc.) and Registered Medical Practitioners (RMPs) as per the requirements. Additional details like registration and qualification credentials can be manually entered and submitted through the portal. Following this, the application is automatically forwarded to the respective State Medical Council for verification. The SMC would then forward the application to the relevant college or institute for further review. Upon successful verification by the State Medical Council, the application is sent to the National Medical Commission. After the NMC verification, a unique NMR ID would be issued. During this process, doctors can opt to join the Healthcare Provider Registry which will link them to the broader digital healthcare ecosystem. Through this portal, all stakeholders, including SMCs and educational institutions can log in and verify applications from a single platform. The NMR portal offers a variety of features, including the ability to add additional qualifications, track applications, suspend licenses, and issue NMR ID cards and digital doctor certificates. The NHA will further provide support for the development of the NMR, including the future release of an enhanced version of the portal. This will include direct integration with the next software, continuing medical education, and credit points. All the MBBS doctors who are already registered on the Indian Medical Register (IMR) have to register again on the NMR of the NMC. To start the registration, the doctor needs to keep ready a digital copy of the Degree (MBBS) Certificate, the Registration Certificate of the State Medical Council/Medical Council of India, where the doctor got first-time registration. The doctor must also have the Aadhaar number ready to start the process.

In the meeting chaired by the Union Health Minister, it was decided that as a matter of abundant caution, certain measures [such as sensitizing the health units at all the airports, seaports, and ground crossings; readying the testing Laboratories (32 in no.); gearing up health facilities for detecting, isolating and managing any case, etc.] are put in place. In the meeting, it was noted that Monkeypox infections are usually self-limiting lasting between 2-4 weeks and patients generally recover with supportive management. The transmission requires prolonged close contact with an infected case and is generally through the sexual route, direct contact with body/lesion fluid, or contaminated clothing/linen of an infected person. WHO had earlier declared Monkeypox as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) in July 2022 and subsequently revoked the same in May 2023. Globally since 2022, WHO has reported 99,176 cases and 208 deaths due to Monkeypox from 116 countries. Since the 2022 declaration by WHO, a total of 30 cases were detected in India with the last case in March 2024. A Joint Monitoring Group Meeting under the Chairmanship of the Director General of Health Services consisting of experts from relevant fields was held on 16th August 2024 to review the situation. The meeting was attended by experts from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), World Health Organization (WHO), Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), National Centre for Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), Directorate General of Health Services (Dte.GHS), Central Government Hospitals, All India Institute of Medical Sciences AIIMS etc. Although the possibility of a few imported cases being detected in the coming weeks is not entirely ruled out, it was assessed that the risk of a large outbreak with sustained transmission is presently low for India. The situation is being monitored closely by the Ministry. *****\\nAKS\\nHFW/HFM reviews Monkeypox situation and preparedness/17th August 2024/2\\n'),\n",

Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has highlighted the importance of organ donation and has given special emphasis on the fact that one organ donor can give new life to up to 8 people.” This was stated by Smt. Anupriya Patel, Union Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare on the occasion of the 14th Indian Organ Donation Day ceremony organized by the National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (NOTTO), here today in the presence of Dr V K Paul, Member (Health), NITI Aayog. Addressing the occasion, Smt. Patel lauded the family members of deceased organ donors for “doing the greatest service to mankind by saving the lives of numerous people”. Calling them an inspiration for the entire country, she encouraged the countrymen to step forward to pledge to donate their organs after death. “It is only through the concerted efforts of every individual and institutions that India can realise its vision of becoming one of the leading countries in organ donation and transplantation”, she said. The Union Minister said that though many countries like Spain, the USA and China are much ahead in organ donation, India has also made some notable achievements in this field in recent times. She also urged officials to take all steps to ensure that no received organs are wasted before getting transplanted. Dr. Vinod Kumar Paul who was also the Guest of Honour at the event highlighted the huge gap between the demand for and supply of organs and noted the need for institutional reforms in the government hospitals to take up the challenge of organ transplantation. He lamented that there are only around 750 institutions providing organ transplantation services and encouraged the other institutions to also come forward to provide such services. Dr Paul informed that kidney transplantation is covered under the AB PM-JAY (Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana) and called upon insurance companies to cover organ transplantation. He also highlighted significant efforts made by the Union Government to ensure ease of organ transplantation like the “One Nation, One Policy” which removed the domicile and age-related roadblocks to organ transplantation. He ended his address by paying tribute to the organ donors and urging people to unitedly come forward towards this noble cause. Union Health Secretary, Shri Apurva Chandra highlighted the need to enhance awareness about organ donation as there are a large number of people registering for need of organs. He mentioned that “although India ranks third in organ transplantation, since most organ donations happen amongst family members, there is a need to inspire people to register for organ donation”. He also stressed that “to ensure that there is no organ wastage, we must strengthen our system. When we receive any brain-dead person, the time is less and we have to harvest the organs in 12 hours and the transplant has to happen within a short window. Hence, we have to improve our systems and it's a big responsibility for NOTTO, SOTTO and ROTTO.”\\nOn the occasion, the Union Minister felicitated 10 family members of deceased donors for their brave decision of donating organs of their loved ones and four recipients of organ donation. Awards were also presented to the best performing States, Regional and State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organizations, medical colleges and institutions, professional societies, medical professionals and Non-Governmental Organizations, etc. to recognize their contribution in the field of organ donation and transplantation. ROTTO North-PGIMER, Chandigarh won the Best ROTTO Award. Telangana bagged the Award for Best SOTTO/State, while Tamil Nadu and Karnataka received the Award for second best SOTTO/ State. Manipur was conferred with Best Emerging State in North East Award. The states winning the Emerging States in Organ Donation Award were: 1) Andhra Pradesh 2) Madhya Pradesh, and 3) Jammu & Kashmir.

As a part of Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav, a special campaign ‘Angdaan Mahotsav’ was organised in the year 2023 throughout the country as a “Jan Andolan”. The month of July is observed as the Organ Donation Month. This year under the campaign titled “Angdaan Jan Jagrukta Abhiyaan” various awareness activities are being organized across the country from city to village level through all Central Government Ministries/Departments, State/UT Governments/National, Regional and State Organ & Tissue networking organizations/Hospitals / Institutions and Medical Colleges, NGOs and other stakeholders. The event was also attended by Dr Anil Kumar, Director, NOTTO; Delhi Police personnel, organ recipients, students, as well as senior officials from the Union Health Ministry. Background:\\nThe Union Government is committed to promote Organ and Tissue donation. The Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has highlighted the importance of organ donation many times in episodes of “Mann ki Baat” program. The Indian Organ Donation Day (IODD) is observed annually since 2010 to augment awareness about brain stem death and organ donation, dispel myths and misconceptions associated with organ donation and motivate and encourage the citizens of the country to donate organs and tissues after death, as well as to imbibe the values of organ donation in their lives. To reduce the demand for organ transplantation, campaign activities also promote adoption of healthy lifestyles, wellness and take steps for prevention of organ failure. The 14th IODD is an opportunity to motivate people to donate organs in order to bridge the existing gap between the number of people in need of organs for transplant and the number of donors. Every donated organ is precious, lifesaving and a national resource. A person after his death can give new life to up to 8 people by donating vital organs namely Kidney, Liver, Lung, Heart, Pancreas and Intestine and improve quality life of many more by donating tissues like cornea, skin, bone and heart valve etc. People are encouraged to come forward to pledge for a noble cause and contribute in this national endeavor. For any information on organ donation and transplantation one can visit the website of NOTTO www.notto.mohfw.gov.in or call tollfree helpline number 180114770. This year under the campaign “Angdaan Jan Jagrukta Abhiyaan” various awareness activities have been organized across the country from city to village level involving all Central Government Ministries/Departments, State/UT Governments/National, Regional and State Organ & Tissue networking organisations/Hospitals / Institutions and Medical Colleges, NGOs and other stakeholders. Under the Abhiyaan, the month of July was observed as the Organ Donation Month. To facilitate citizens to pledge for organ and tissue donation, a web portal https://notto.abdm.gov.in is functional through which till now, more than 1.7 lakh citizens have come forward and registered their pledge since 17th September, 2023. *****\\nMV\\nHFW/14th IODD/03August2024/1\\n'),\n",

This disease not only impacts health and well-being but also leads to lifelong disability, due to lymphedema, affecting families profoundly. To ensure success in the upcoming MDA rounds it is imperative that 90% of all eligible populations consume these medicines.” He stressed on the need to have dedicated efforts to prevent and eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis in India. Shri Jadhav also noted that efforts are being made to ensure pucca houses for people living in mud houses that make them more vulnerable to such diseases. He said efforts will also be made to develop a vaccine for Lymphatic Filariasis. He also highlighted that Disability Certificates are provided to the people affected with Lymphatic Filariasis. He launched the MDA campaign by consuming the medicine himself and applauded the dedication and efforts of the line ministries, self-help groups, and other stakeholders for their contribution to the success of the campaign. State Health Ministers spoke about their achievements and efforts in the direction of eliminating Lymphatic Filariasis since the inception of the Elimination of the Lymphatic Filariasis programme in 2004. They also thanked the Union Government for their unwavering support and assured their commitment towards eliminating the disease. Smt. Aradhana Patnaik, Additional Secretary and MD (NHM), Health Ministry, stated that Lymphatic Filariasis is a preventable disease and this MDA campaign is currently being launched in 6 states.

She stated that the focus this time is not only on the distribution of medicines but to ensure their consumption so that the campaign achieves a success. Smt. Vandana Jain, Joint Secretary, Health Ministry emphasised that “Lymphatic Filariasis, a mosquito-borne disease is preventable through simple measures, therefore, the Mass Drug Administration (MDA) rounds are crucial in halting its transmission.\"\\nDr Atul Goel, Director General of Health Services; Smt. Vandana Jain, Joint Secretary, Health Ministry; Dr Tanu Jain, Director, National Centre for Vector-Borne Diseases and senior officials of the Union Health Ministry were present on the occasion. Background\\nLymphatic filariasis (LF) commonly known as elephantiasis (Haatipaon), is a serious debilitating disease transmitted through the bite of a Culex mosquito that breeds in dirty/polluted water. Infection is usually acquired in childhood causing hidden damage to the lymphatic system with visible manifestations (lymphoedema, elephantiasis, and scrotal swelling/hydrocele) which occur later in life and can lead to permanent disability. Lymphatic Filariasis (Haatipaon) is a priority disease that is targeted for elimination by 2027. Currently, LF has been reported in 345 districts across 20 states and union territories, with 90% of LF burden contributed by 8 states - Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. India has employed a comprehensive five-pronged strategy: Mission mode MDA, Morbidity Management and Disability Prevention (MMDP), Vector control (Surveillance and Management), High-level advocacy, and Innovative approaches for the elimination of LF. 138 (40%) of the total endemic districts stopped Mass Drug Administration and cleared Transmission Assessment Survey (TAS 1), 159 districts of 13 states reported Mf >1 conducting Annual Mass Drug Administration and 41 districts are in various stages of Pre TAS/TAS, 5 districts failed Pre TAS (>1 Mf rate in 8 blocks) and 2 districts of Assam postponed MDA to 2025. Till 2023, 6.19 lakh cases of lymphoedema and 1.27 lakh cases of hydrocele were reported from all the endemic districts. MDA Campaign\\nIndia\\'s efforts to eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) have seen significant progress with the launch of the Enhanced Strategy for LF Elimination by 2027. This strategy includes the mission mode Annual Mass Drug Administration (MDA) campaign, conducted biannually on 10th February and 10th August alongside National Deworming Day (NDD). In 2023, MDA was conducted in two phases, and reached 82% coverage nationally across 170 districts in 12 states, emphasizing Directly Observed Consumption. In 2024, the first phase of the MDA campaign was conducted in 96 districts across 11 states and reported national coverage of 95% against the eligible population. For a successful execution of the MDA campaign, it is essential to provide information to all the households about the importance of the anti-filaria drug consumption to attain the targeted drug compliance of more than 90% against the eligible population. As part of the second phase of the MDA campaign on 10th August 2024, 63 districts (38 triple drug & 25 double drug), and 771 blocks across 6 states are conducting the MDA campaign. ****\\nMV\\nHFW/LFMDA Campaign /10 August 2024/1\\n'),\n",

Reduction in road traffic can lead to smoother movement of vehicles, reduction in travel time, increasing overall road safety etc. Environmental Benefits:\\nThe addition of Phase-3 Metro Rail Project and increase in overall Metro Rail Network in Bengaluru city, can significantly reduce carbon emissions compared to traditional fossil fuel-based transport. Economic Growth:\\nReduced travel times and improved access to different parts of the city can enhance productivity by allowing individuals to reach their workplaces more efficiently. The construction and operation of Phase-3 will generate numerous jobs in various sectors, from construction workers to administrative staff and maintenance personnel. Also, the enhanced connectivity can stimulate local businesses, especially in areas near new metro stations which can also attract investment and development in previously less accessible regions. Social Impact:\\nThe expansion of Phase-3 Metro Rail network in Bengaluru will provide more equitable access to public transport, benefiting diverse socio-economic groups and reducing transport disparities which will contribute to a higher quality of life by reducing commute times and improving access to essential services. Multi-Modal Integration& Last Mile Connectivity:\\nMulti-Modal Integration is planned at 10 locations at JP Nagar 4th Phase, JP Nagar, Kamakya, Mysore Road, Sumanahalli, Peenya, BEL Circle, Hebbal, Kempapura, Hosahalli and provides interchanges with existing and under construction Metro Stations, BMTC Bus stands, Indian Railway Stations, proposed Suburban (K-RIDE) Stations. All the Phase-3 stations are proposed with dedicated bus bays, Pick up and drop off bays, Pedestrian Paths, IPT/Auto Rickshaw stands. BMTC is already running feeder buses to the operational metro stations and the same will be extended to the Phase-3 stations also. Parking facilities have been provided at 11 important stations. The existing stations of Phase-1 & Phase-2 are integrated with proposed stations of Phase-3.Direct connectivity through FoBs/Skywalks to two Railway stations (Lottegollahali and Hebbal). At Phase-3 metro stations, provision for bikes and cycles sharing facility has also been provided. *****\\nMJPS/BM/SKS\\n\"),\n",

As per 7th Schedule of the Constitution of India, Land & Colonisation are State subjects. Therefore, it is the primary responsibility of States/Union Territories (UTs) to take steps and devise schemes to provide for rehabilitation of homeless persons. Central Government is supplementing the efforts of State Governments/UTs through programs and schematic interventions. MoHUA administers ‘Shelters for Urban Homeless (SUH)’ under Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana–National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM), through respective States/ UTs. It focuses on providing permanent shelters equipped with basic facilities to the urban homeless. As per SUH guidelines, convergence of various entitlements of social security, food, education, health care systems, provision for admission of the homeless children to government school, skill training, etc is provided. In addition, MoHUA also implements Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Urban (PMAY-U) for providing assistance to States/UTs for addressing the housing requirement of eligible urban households. PMAY-U envisages to provide all weather pucca houses with basic civic amenities to all eligible urban households. As per the operational guidelines of SUH, the agency running the shelter shall have the responsibility of identifying the homeless persons and persuading them to come to the shelter. Further, the guidelines prescribe active involvement of the local police in tracing the family of the homeless, whenever required. In addition, the guidelines provide for collection of socio-demographic particulars of the individuals at the time of admission to the shelter. If required, counselling support is provided to the residents, seeking details of their native place. If the homeless individual is deserted from the family, the concerned state authority makes enquiry/counselling session with the family to explore the possibilities of immediate reintegration with the involvement of concerned Welfare departments / Police / NGOs / CBOs, etc. This information was given by the Minister of State for Housing & Urban Affairs, Shri Tokhan Sahu, in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today. *****\\nMJPS/SK\\n'),\n",

Addressing the media, he noted that prior to 2014, the Metro Rail system in India was limited to just 248 km and operational in only 5 cities. Over the last ten years,700 km of new Metro lines have been made operational, bringing the total operational length to 945 km, and extending Metro services to 21 cities across the country. Highlighting the rapid progress, Shri Manohar Lal stated, \"Before 2014, on average, only 600 meters of Metro line was being constructed per month. Today, this figure has increased tenfold to 6 km per month, demonstrating the government’s commitment to urban development under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.\"\\nThe Union Minister also announced the recent approval of three major Metro Rail projects by the Union Cabinet, underscoring the government’s dedication to enhancing urban infrastructure. These include:\\n- Bengaluru Metro Project:\\xa0 44 km expansion comprising two corridors. - Thane Metro Project: 29 km network aimed at reducing congestion on the roads of Thane. - Pune Metro Project: A 5.5 km route to further improve urban mobility in the city. Shri Manohar Lal also highlighted the significant strides made in indigenization, with the majority of civil structures being constructed domestically. He pointed out that India has developed four state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities of metro coaches that have produced over 1,000 Metro coaches in the last five years, supporting various Metro rail systems across the country. With the approval of these new projects, India now has 1,018 km of Metro lines under construction. The Minister proudly mentioned that India currently ranks third globally in terms of operational Metro network length, following China and the USA. \"We are poised to soon surpass the USA and become second only to China,\" he remarked, attributing this success to the ‘Make in India’ initiative championed by Prime Minister Modi. In addition to domestic achievements, the Minister spoke of the growing international interest in India’s expertise in Metro rail systems. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) is currently implementing a Metro rail system in Bangladesh and has provided consultancy services in Jakarta. Countries like Israel, Saudi Arabia (Riyadh), Kenya, and El Salvador have also shown interest in partnering with DMRC for their Metro development projects. Regarding the Rapid Rail Transit System (RRTS), Shri Manohar Lal provided updates on the Delhi-Meerut corridor. \"Under the visionary leadership of the Hon’ble Prime Minister, the first RRTS corridor of 82 km between Delhi and Meerut has been sanctioned at a cost of Rs. 30,274 crore. Today, 34 km of this corridor is operational, with the ‘NaMo Bharat’ train running on this network. We expect the project to be fully completed by June 2025.\"\\nAddressing the issue of additional RRTS corridors, the Minister acknowledged delays due to resistance from the Delhi government but assured that the remaining two priority corridors connecting Gurugram, Manesar, and Dharuhera in the south of Delhi, and Sonepat and Panipat in the north of Delhi, will soon be sanctioned. ****\\nSushil Kumar\\n'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Cabinet_approves_rolling_out_Private_FM_.txt', 'Ministry': 'Ministry_of_Information_Broadcasting', 'Month': 'Aug24html'}, page_content='Cabinet approves rolling out Private FM Radio to 234 uncovered new cities / towns\\n\\nMove likely to boost local content in mother tongue and create new employment opportunitiesNew areas covered include many Aspirational, LWE affected and border areas\\nThe Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the proposal for conduct of 3rd batch of ascending e-auctions for 730 channels in 234 new cities with estimated reserve price of Rs.784.87 crore under Private FM Radio Phase Ill Policy. State-wise list of the cities / towns and the number of Private FM channels approved for fresh auctions is enclosed as Annexure. The Cabinet also approved the proposal to charge Annual License Fee (ALF) of FM channel as 4% of Gross Revenue excluding Goods and Services Tax (GST). This will be applicable for 234 new cities / towns. The Private FM Radio rollout in 234 new cities / towns will fulfil the unmet demand for FM radio in these cities / towns, which still remain uncovered by Private FM radio broadcasting and bring new / local content in mother tongue. It will lead to creation of new employment opportunities, boost to local dialect and culture and ‘vocal for local’ initiatives. Many of the approved cities / towns are in Aspirational districts and LWE affected areas. Setting up of Private FM Radio in these areas will further strengthen Government outreach in these areas.

At the start of Jal Jeevan Mission in August 2019, only 3.23 Crore (16.8%) rural households were reported to have tap water connections. So far, as reported by States/ UTs as on 05.08.2024, around 11.81 Crore additional rural households have been provided with tap water connections under JJM. Thus, as on 05.08.2024, out of 19.32 Crore rural households in the country, more than 15.04 Crore (77.87%) households are reported to have tap water supply in their homes. Under life-changing Jal Jeevan Mission, efforts are being made to bring improvements in the lives of rural people by providing potable tap water supply in their homes. With the prioritized implementation of the Mission across the country, positive impacts are being assessed by reputed national and international institutions/ individuals. A few of these are listed as under:\\nTo ensure long term sustainability of infrastructure created, quality material and quality construction is being ensured through third party inspection before making payment. Moreover, measurement and monitoring of water supply in villages through sensor-based IoT solution, linking AADHAR of the head of household for targeted delivery subject to statutory provisions, geo-tagging of assets created, etc. are also provisioned under JJM. Further, to bring transparency and effective monitoring, an online ‘JJM dashboard’ & mobile App has been created, which provides State/ UT, district, and village-wise progress as well as status of provision of tap water supply to rural homes. Moreover, to instill the sense of ownership among the rural communities and Panchayats, the aspects of village level planning and community participation in all decisions pertaining to water supply systems have been included in the design of JJM. Some of the major initiatives taken up under the mission for participation of rural community are listed as under:\\nProvisions for taking up augmentation and strengthening of local drinking water sources in convergence with other schemes viz. MGNREGS, 15th Finance Commission grants to Rural Local Bodies (RLBs)/ Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs), Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP), State schemes, MP/ MLA-LAD funds, District Mineral Development Fund, CSR funds, community contribution, etc. have also been envisaged under the JJM. In addition, to address the issue of operation & maintenance of water supply schemes, provision has also been made under JJM to reward/ incentivize the community in a phased-manner after the commissioning of the scheme to the tune of 10% of the capital expenditure on their respective in-village water supply scheme along with collection of user charges. Water being a State subject, States/ UTs have been advised to undertake testing of water quality on a periodic basis and take remedial action wherever necessary, to ensure that the water supplied to households is of prescribed quality to meet health and safety standards. Moreover, to encourage water quality testing to ensure potable drinking water supply, States/ UTs have opened water quality testing laboratories to general public for testing of their water samples at a nominal rate. To enable States/ UTs to test water samples for water quality, and for sample collection, reporting, monitoring and surveillance of drinking water sources, an online JJM – Water Quality Management Information System (WQMIS) portal has been developed. To treat greywater/ wastewater coming out of the households, the States/ UTs are encouraged to build soak pits in rural areas using JJM funds under convergence. States have informed that lack of dependable drinking water sources in water-stressed, drought prone and desert areas, presence of geo-genic contaminants in ground water, uneven geographical terrain, scattered rural habitations, delay in release of the matching State share in some States, lack of technical capacity with implementing agencies, Gram Panchayats and local communities to plan, manage, operate & maintain the water supply schemes, rising price of raw materials, delay in obtaining statutory/ other clearances, etc. are few of problems being faced in the implementation of the Mission. To address the challenges holistically and overcome these, Government of India has taken a number of steps, inter alia including implementation of Special Assistance to States for Capital Expenditure through M/o Finance for financial assistance as 50-year interest free loan for capital investment projects; nomination of a nodal officer in the Department for coordinating with Central nodal Ministries/ Departments/ agencies to facilitate the States in obtaining Statutory/ other clearances; setting up of State Programme Management Units (SPMUs) and District Programme Management Units (DPMUs) and implementation of ‘Nal Jal Mitra Programme’ for ensuring availability of skilled local persons at village level to bridge the gap in availability of technical skill sets and of HR for programme management.

At the start of Jal Jeevan Mission in August 2019, only 3.23 Crore (16.8%) rural households were reported to have tap water connections. So far, as reported by States/ UTs as on 01.08.2024, around 11.80 Crore additional rural households have been provided with tap water connections. Thus, as on 01.08.2024, out of 19.32 Crore rural households in the country, more than 15.03 Crore (77.83%) households are reported to have tap water supply in their homes. As on date, 11 States/ UTs have become ‘Har Ghar Jal’ States/ UT i.e. 100% households are having tap water supply and the remaining States/ UTs are in at various stages of achieving the objectives of the mission. The State/ UT-wise status of tap water connection provided under the Mission in rural areas is also in public domain and available on JJM dashboard at:\\nhttps://ejalshakti.gov.in/jjmreport/JJMIndia.aspx\\nStates have informed that lack of dependable drinking water sources in water-stressed, drought prone and desert areas, presence of geo-genic contaminants in ground water, uneven geographical terrain, scattered rural habitations, delay in release of the matching State share in some States, lack of technical capacity with implementing agencies, Gram Panchayats and local communities to plan, manage, operate & maintain the water supply schemes, rising price of raw materials, delay in obtaining statutory/ other clearances, etc. are few of problems being faced in the implementation of the Mission. To address the challenges holistically and overcome these, Government of India has taken a number of steps, inter alia including implementation of Special Assistance to States for Capital Expenditure through M/o Finance for financial assistance as 50-year interest free loan for capital investment projects; nomination of a nodal officer in the Department for coordinating with Central nodal Ministries/ Departments/ agencies to facilitate the States in obtaining Statutory/ other clearances; setting up of State Programme Management Units (SPMUs) and District Programme Management Units (DPMUs) and implementation of ‘Nal Jal Mitra Programme’ for ensuring availability of skilled local persons at village level to bridge the gap in availability of technical skill sets and of HR for programme management;\\nUnder the mission, States have been advised for source recharging, viz. dedicated bore well recharge structures, rainwater recharge, rejuvenation of existing water bodies, reuse of greywater, etc., in convergence with other schemes such as MGNREGS, Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP), 15th Finance Commission tied grants to RLBs/ PRIs, State schemes, CSR funds, etc. Further, Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain (JSA: CTR) campaign aiming to encourage water conservation at grass-root levels with people's participation was launched in 2019 in 256 water stressed districts of the country. Morever, recognizing the importance of sustainable water management especially for drinking water availability, JSA-CTR was implemented with the theme ‘Source Sustainability for Drinking Water’ in 2023. Similarly, in 2024, JSA is being implemented with the theme ‘Nari Shakti se Jal Shakti’ from 09.03.2024 to 30.11.2024 emphasizing the pivotal role played by women in the field of water conservation. As per Operational Guidelines of JJM, after making provision of tap connections to all rural households in a village, the Department implementing the scheme provides completion certificate to Gram Panchayat and marks the village as ‘Har Ghar Jal’ village on JJM-IMIS. Subsequently, Gram Panchayats in its Gram Sabha meeting after reading out aloud the work completion report, formally passes resolution certifying itself as ‘Har Ghar Jal’ village.

Drinking Water being a state subject, the responsibility of planning, approval, implementation, operation, and maintenance of drinking water supply schemes, including those under the Jal Jeevan Mission, lies with State/UT Governments. The Government of India supports the States by providing technical and financial assistance. At the time of announcement of Jal Jeevan Mission on 15th August 2019, 3.23 Crore (17%) rural households were reported to have tap water connections. So far, as reported by States/ UTs as on 31.07.2024, around 11.80 Crore additional rural households have been provided with tap water connections. Thus, as on 31.07.2024, out of 19.32 Crore rural households, in 5.83 lakh villages, in the country, more than 15.03 Crore (77.81%) households spread in around 5.80 lakh villages, are reported to have tap water supply in their homes. Further, as on 31.07.2024 around 2.31 lakh villages are reported as “Har Ghar Jal”. Under the Jal Jeevan Mission, as per existing guidelines, Bureau of Indian Standards’ BIS:10500 standards are adopted as benchmarks for ensuring the quality of water being supplied through the piped water supply schemes. Under JJM, while planning water supply schemes to provide tap water supply to households, priority is given to quality-affected habitations. While allocating the funds to States/ UTs in a particular financial year, 10% weightage is given to the population residing in habitations affected by chemical contaminants including Arsenic and Fluoride. Under JJM, contamination in drinking water sources in rural areas is monitored on habitation wise. Since launch of Jal Jeevan Mission, the number of Arsenic and Fluoride affected habitations has reduced over the years. As reported by States/ UTs, as on 31.07.2024, there are 316 Arsenic and 265 Fluoride affected rural habitations in the country. Provision of potable drinking water for cooking and drinking requirements has been made in all these remaining 316 Arsenic–affected and 265 Fluoride-affected habitations through Community Water Purification Plants (CWPPs).

Further, the year over year analysis shows a growth of 7.86% in net member additions compared to June 2023. This surge in membership can be attributed to numerous factors, including increased employment opportunities, a growing awareness of employee benefits, and the effectiveness of EPFO's outreach programs. The data indicates that around 10.25 lakh new members have enrolled during June 2024. There is an increase of 4.08% in the new members from the previous month of May 2024 and 1.05% increase from the previous year June 2023. A noticeable aspect of the data is the dominance of the 18-25 age group, constituting a significant 59.14% of the total new members added in June 2024. This is in consonance with the earlier trend which indicates that most individuals joining the organized workforce are youth, primarily first-time job seekers. The payroll data highlights that approximately 14.15 lakh members exited and subsequently rejoined EPFO. This figure depicts year over year growth of 11.79% compared to June 2023. These members switched their jobs and re-joined the establishments covered under the ambit of EPFO and opted to transfer their accumulations instead of applying for final settlement thus, safeguarding long-term financial well-being and extending their social security protection. Gender-wise analysis of payroll data unveils that out of new members added during the month, around 2.98 lakh are new female members. This figure exhibits year over year growth of 5.88% compared to June 2023. Also, the net female member addition during the month stood at around 4.28 lakh reflecting year over year growth of 8.91% compared to June 2023. The surge in female member additions is indicative of a broader shift towards a more inclusive and diverse workforce. State-wise analysis of payroll data denotes that net member addition is highest in the five states/ UTs of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Haryana. These states constitute around 61.16% of net member addition, adding a total of 11.8 lakh net members during the month. Of all the states, Maharashtra is leading by adding 21.09% of net members during the month. Month-on-month comparison of industry-wise data displays significant growth in the members working in establishments engaged in the industries viz University, college, school. etc., School, Financing establishment, General insurance, College, Societies clubs or associations, University, Electronic media companies in private sector etc. Of the total net membership, around 40.70% addition is from expert services (consisting of manpower suppliers, normal contractors, security services, miscellaneous activities etc.). The above payroll data is provisional since the data generation is a continuous exercise, as updating employee record is a continuous process. The previous data gets updated every month. From the month of April-2018, EPFO has been releasing payroll data covering the period September 2017 onwards. In monthly payroll data, the count of members joining EPFO for the first time through Aadhaar validated Universal Account Number (UAN), existing members exiting from coverage of EPFO and those who exited but re-joined as members, is taken to arrive at net monthly payroll. *****\\nHimanshu Pathak\\n\"),\n",

The legal Education Rules, 2008 lay down the mandatory minimum standards and requirements for legal education in India. The BCI has informed that it periodically reviews and updates the curriculum to ensure that it remains relevant and comprehensive, and that it addresses the changing needs of the legal profession. The BCI has encouraged the law schools to include emerging areas of law, such as Intellectual Property Law, Cyber Law, and Environmental Law, in their curriculum. To make law courses more practical, the BCI has also introduced clinical legal education, which requires students to participate in internships, moot courts, and legal aid clinics. This helps students gain practical experience and develop their skills in a real-world setting. As per vision of Hon’ble Prime Minister the BCI has issued circular to all Universities and Centres of Legal Education to incorporate subjects such as block chains, electronic discovery, cyber-security, robotics, Artificial Intelligence and bio-ethics etc. in their curricula. Requisite Circular has also been issued to include the recently introduced three Criminal Laws i.e. Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, and the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023 in the curriculum. Overall, the BCI is aware that curriculum of law courses in India remains comprehensive, practical and relevant to the needs of the legal profession and ensures that the graduates are well equipped to handle contemporary legal challenges. Although, the BCI oversees the legal profession in India but it does not determine the fees for Advocates or Senior Advocates. Therefore, the matter of providing stipends to the junior advocates are totally at the discretion of the individual advocates and senior advocates. The BCI has further informed that the Delhi High Court vide order dated 25th July, 2024 in the case of Simran Kumari vs BCI & Anrs.,{W.P. (c) 10159/2024} has directed to consider representations regarding payment of minimum stipend to junior lawyers hired by advocates and senior advocates.

Several circulars have been issued by BCI to State Governments and Universities to meticulously scrutinise the applications of new law Colleges before granting them NOCs and affiliations. If any deficiencies are found on the part of any Centres of Legal Educations (CLEs), the approval of affiliation are not granted. Moratorium to grant NOCs and affiliation to new law colleges and additional sections in existing centres was issued vide resolution dated 11.08.2019 which was subsequently overturned by Punjab and Haryana High Court in its order dated 04.12.2020. The BCI has also constituted a High-Level Committee headed by a former Chief Justice of High Court to identify such Centres of Legal Education which are not complying with the infrastructural, faculty, library and other requirements of Rules of Legal Education by conducting surprise inspections of these Centres of Legal Education without their knowledge. On the basis of the Report of High-Powered Surprise Inspection Committee, the BCI conducts rigorous inspections of Centres of Legal Educations (CLEs). Further, based on not meeting the standard, several CLEs have been barred from admitting students for the academic year 2024-25.

The Government of India, through the Department of Justice as the nodal department, launched the Citizens’ Duties Awareness Programme (CDAP) on November 26, 2019, aiming to increase awareness of the Constitution with a focus on Fundamental Duties.CDAP was able to reach over 48.6 crore citizens through effective implementation of various programmes by various Ministries/Departments of the Government of India, States/UTs, Judiciary and NSS/NYK Volunteers. The program utilized tools such as online Preamble reading (21.86 lakh), online Pledge taking (1.90 lakh), Webinars (10,600), messaging through E-tickets (14.5 Cr), and social media (10.95 Cr). Over 86 Ministries/Departments engaged in the year-long CDAP activities. Additionally, 31 lakh elected Gram Panchayat representatives and 14,500 Special Gram Sabhas promoted the concept of Fundamental Duties among citizen. The DoJ launched a grassroots campaign in 1000 digital villages through the CSC network, covering 310 districts across 16 states. This effort included 2409 awareness sessions, reaching over 4,84,000 villagers, 9000 wall paintings, and signature banners displayed on fundamental duties in all digital villages. During the current year, the Department of Justice has initiated a pan-India, year-long nationwide campaign titled ‘Hamara Samvidhan Hamara Samman’ to celebrate the 75th year of India as a Republic and the adoption of India’s Constitution. The campaign was launched on January 24, 2024, by the Hon’ble Vice-President of India. Following this, regional events were organized in Bikaner, Rajasthan, on March 9, 2024, and in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, on July 16, 2024, to ensure decentralized outreach of the campaign.This campaign aims to reaffirm our collective commitment to the principles enshrined in the Constitution of India and to celebrate the shared values that bind our nation. This nationwide initiative provides opportunities for every citizen to participate in various ways, empowering them to contribute meaningfully through its sub-campaigns: Sabko Nyaya HarGhar Nyaya, Nav Bharat Nav Sankalp, and Vidhi Jagriti Abhiyaan. Through the network of Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLEs) of the Common Service Centres (CSCs), over 2.5 lakh gram panchayats have been engaged in reading the Panch Pran Pledge in regional languages. In 25 States/Union Territories, citizen-centric service fairs called “Nyaya Sewa Melas” have been organized. Online competitions such as the Samvidhan Quiz, Panch Pran Rangotsav (poster-making), and Panch Pran Anubhav (reel-making) were launched on the MyGov platform. To enhance constitutional education, the campaign has involved law students and partnered with agencies like Doordarshan and IGNOU’s Gyan Vani and Gyan Darshan platforms.As of June 30, 2024, 1.60 lakh citizens have participated in the ‘Hamara Samvidhan Hamara Samman’ campaign nationwide. Information to popularize the understanding of the Constitution as part of this campaign is regularly updated on the Department of Justice website https://doj.gov.in/. The Department of Justice (DoJ) is also implementing a dedicated program for legal literacy and legal awareness under the scheme of the \"Designing Innovative Solutions for Holistic Access to Justice\" (DISHA), introduced in 2021. As of June 30, 2024, the legal awareness has reached 15.30 lakh individuals through community engagement, webinars, and the dissemination of educational materials on the Constitution, legal rights, and duties. The National Legal Services Authority (NALSA), through its Legal Services Authorities at the state, district, and taluk levels, conducts legal literacy and awareness programs and campaigns to educate the general public about their rights, benefits, and privileges guaranteed by the Constitution and other enactments. NALSA through the Legal Services Authorities has undertaken the following steps to popularize the understanding of the Constitution and to increase the awareness about the legal rights:\\n(i)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A six-week-long Pan India Legal Awareness and Outreach Campaign was organized from October 2 to November 14, 2021, as part of the ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’. Conducted in four phases, the campaign reached 6.7 lakh villages and 4100 municipal towns across the country to raise awareness about the availability of free legal services. Additionally, 1623 Legal Services Mega Camps (NALSA Module) were held in 735 districts, benefiting 75,64,236 people. (ii)\\xa0\\xa0 A nationwide legal awareness and outreach program titled “Empowerment of Citizens through Legal Awareness and Outreach” was conducted from October 31 to November 13, 2022. The campaign aimed to bridge the gap between institutions and the underprivileged by spreading legal awareness and ensuring the delivery of legal entitlements to eligible beneficiaries. It was organized across all villages and sub-divisions of every district in India. Concurrently, the “Haq_humara_bhi_to_hai@75” campaign was launched, focusing on providing basic legal assistance to individuals confined in prisons and child care institutions. The Legal Services Authorities have conducted a range of legal awareness programs covering various laws and schemes related to children, laborers, disaster victims, SC/ST communities, and persons with disabilities. Additionally, they have created and distributed booklets and pamphlets in accessible language to inform the public about these laws.To effectively reach vulnerable sections of society, NALSA has developed and implemented a Module for Legal Services Camps through Legal Services Institutions. This approach marks a shift from traditional methods of general legal awareness to a model focused on true empowerment, grounded in need-based analysis and targeted action. The Legal Empowerment Camps are designed to serve not only the weak and marginalized sections but also those residing in remote and far-flung areas, aiming to bridge information gaps and ensure access to citizens’ rightful entitlements. Since the framework\\'s approval in December 2017, these camps have been organized nationwide with a three-fold objective: firstly, to spread awareness about various welfare legislations and schemes; secondly, to identify and reach out to individuals who need legal assistance; and lastly, to provide tailored solutions to legal issues.In 2023-2024 alone, 30,043 legal awareness camps were organized, benefiting 11.46 lakh citizens.To further enhance and educate citizens on existing awareness programs, campaigns, and other legal aid avenues, NALSA leverages mass media platforms and Legal Services Institutions.
